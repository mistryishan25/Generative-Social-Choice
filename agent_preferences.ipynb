       "\"I (F) was playing games with my boyfriend, and his friends. We played a game where the goal is to make a controversial prompt that the players of the game will be split on. The more split it is, the more points. Some more background about me, this is important. I was adopted by other relatives and have lived with them since I was 1. My bio mother is dead and has been for my entire life. I don't remember anything about her. I dont fully remember what the prompt was, it was something about getting money by having to delete the only picture of something you have off your phone. My boyfriend filled in the blank and wrote that the only picture you'd have to delete would be of your birth mom. I immediately said I felt targeted, and he told me I was. I was not happy and I asked him why he did that in our DMs. He told me he did it because he wanted to win and wanted the split. He said sorry, but, he was insistent that he thought it wouldn't be a big deal and i wouldn't be so hurt. He told me he felt awful afterwards and like I had gotten way too upset. AITA?\""

      "REASONING = Based on my comment, I think OP's feelings are valid and her boyfriend should have been more understanding and empathetic (10). I also agree that the game's goal is to be controversial, but that doesn't mean it's okay to hurt someone's feelings (3). It's important for OP to set boundaries and communicate what is and isn't okay to joke about (5), and I think the boyfriend's actions were not just about winning the game, but also about targeting OP specifically (9). I also believe that the boyfriend's apology was insincere, as he implied OP was overreacting (4), and his actions show he's willing to hurt OP for personal gain (6), which is a red flag in the relationship (7). I think the game is meant to be uncomfortable, but that doesn't mean OP should just accept being hurt (8). I ranked the statement about the boyfriend crossing a line (1) last because while I think it's true, I think the other statements are more important in this situation.\n"

      "REASONING: Based on my comment, I agree that going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay (2). I also think that forcing someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries (3). Sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation (4), and not respecting someone's wishes can make them feel uncomfortable or even stressed (9). I agree that a simple 'thank you' or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation (10). I agree that everyone involved is trying to do the right thing, but some methods are better than others (6), and it's better to be transparent and direct when showing appreciation, rather than sneaky or manipulative (7). Instead of paying for services, consider doing something nice for the person, like taking them out for a meal (5) and making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment (8). I think respecting people's wishes and boundaries, even if it's a kind gesture (1) is less important than the other statements because it's important to consider the other person's feelings and boundaries.\n"

Statement 9 (You both sound immature and shouldn't be in a relationship with anyone yet.) is also in line with my comment and is placed second. Statement 1 (She stole your car and held your stuff hostage.) is placed third because while it is a clear violation of trust, it is not the only issue in this relationship. Statement 8 (She's lucky you didn't call the cops on her when she said she wasn't coming back that night.) is placed fourth, as it highlights the girlfriend's irresponsible behavior. Statement 6 (She's not trustworthy and has more red flags than a warning sign.) is placed fifth, as it further emphasizes the lack of trust in the relationship. Statement 4 (She was trying to teach you a lesson by lying and stealing your car.) is placed sixth, as it suggests a manipulative behavior from the girlfriend. Statement 11 (You both play too many games and it's better to end the relationship.) is placed seventh, as it highlights the unhealthy dynamics in the relationship. Statement 12 (She locked you out of her apartment to control the situation.) is placed eighth, as it further emphasizes the controlling behavior of the girlfriend. Statement 3 (You could've called the police when she didn't return the car.) is placed ninth, as it suggests a lack of action from the OP. Statement 5 (You should have zero contact with her at work and consider looking for a new job.) is placed tenth, as it suggests a more extreme measure that may not be necessary. Statement 7 (You both fell in love because of unresolved trauma and need therapy.) is placed eleventh, as it suggests a deeper underlying issue that may not be fully addressed. Statement 10 (She needs professional help and anger management classes.) is placed twelfth, as it focuses solely on the girlfriend's behavior and not the overall dynamics of the relationship.\n",

I also think that the wife should make an effort to improve her cooking (8), but I believe that the husband should also crack his own eggs if he has a problem with the way they're made (3).

      "REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the FIL is an asshole for making food that the OP couldn't eat. However, I do agree that idling a truck for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel (statement 4). I also agree that older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes (statement 5). It's important to communicate with the neighbor (statement 14) and check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (statement 3). I also agree that the neighbor should be considerate of the OP's situation and not take it personally if they ask them to stop idling their truck (statement 14). I think it's important to check if the neighbor is violating any environmental ordinances by idling their truck (statement 15) and if they are allowed to park their truck on the street (statement 10). I also agree that stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK (statement 7). I think it's important to check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (statement 3) before taking any drastic measures such as reporting the neighbor to the police (statement 2) or taking the truck to the nearest police station and leaving it there (statement 13). I also think that using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor (statement 11) or recording the engine noise and playing it back to the neighbor to make a point (statement 8) may not be the best course of action. I think using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation (statement 6) or talking to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation (statement 14) may be more effective. I also think that putting a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement (statement 9) is not an appropriate solution.\n",

This statement acknowledges the potential need for idling, but also highlights the excessive nature of the neighbor's behavior. Statement 4, which states that idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel, aligns with my view that the neighbor's behavior is unreasonable. Statement 1, which suggests talking to the neighbor and asking them to stop idling their truck, is a reasonable request, but I agree with my own comment that the neighbor should have stopped pestering the OP when they said no. Statement 7, which points out that stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK, is a valid point, but may not be relevant to the OP's situation.

Statement 13, which suggests taking the truck to the nearest police station and leaving it there, is an extreme measure that I do not believe is warranted in this situation. Statement 11, which suggests using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor, is an aggressive and confrontational approach that I do not condone. Statement 12, which suggests calling the police every day to report the noise until something is done, is also an extreme and confrontational approach that I do not believe is necessary. Statement 9, which suggests putting a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement, is a juvenile and potentially dangerous prank that I strongly advise against.

      "REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that the first step should be to communicate with the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck (14). If the neighbor is unaware that they are causing a disturbance, they may simply be oblivious and not intentionally trying to annoy the poster. If talking to the neighbor does not work, then the next step would be to check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (1, 7, 15). If the neighbor is violating these laws, then reporting them to the police would be appropriate (2). However, it is important to note that idling for a short period of time may be necessary for older diesel trucks to warm up (5), so it is worth checking with the neighbor to see if this is the case before taking any further action. If the idling is excessive and unnecessary, then it is a waste of fuel (4) and the neighbor would be TA if they continue to do it. In the meantime, the poster could consider using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation (6). If the situation escalates and the neighbor refuses to stop idling their truck, then more drastic measures such as leaving the truck at the police station (13) or calling the police every day (12) could be considered. However, these options should be a last resort as they may further escalate the situation. Overall, the goal should be to communicate with the neighbor and find a peaceful resolution to the issue.\n",

It's important to try to communicate with the neighbor first and ask them to stop idling their truck, especially since it is unnecessary and a waste of fuel. If the neighbor is violating any local laws or environmental ordinances, then it would be appropriate to report them. However, it's best to gather evidence and information first by checking local laws and ordinances and recording the engine noise. If the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street and is not violating any laws, then it may be worth considering using noise-cancelling methods like earplugs or a noise machine to help with sleep deprivation. It's also important to approach the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation.

I included using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation (6) because it's possible that the noise may be unavoidable and the OP may need to find alternative ways to sleep. I included recording the engine noise and playing it back to the neighbor to make a point (8) and using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor (11) because it may help to make the neighbor aware of the noise they are making. I included calling the police every day to report the noise until something is done (12) and taking the truck to the nearest police station and leaving it there (13) as last resorts if the neighbor refuses to stop idling their truck. I included putting a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement (9) as the least preferred option because it's not a productive way to resolve the issue and could potentially damage the neighbor's truck.\n",

      "REASONING = Based on my comment, I think the best course of action is to record the engine noise and play it back to the neighbor (8) to make a point about the excessive noise. Talking to the neighbor and asking them to stop idling their truck (1) is also a reasonable request. I included idling for 30 minutes being unnecessary and a waste of fuel (4) and checking local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (3) as they are important to consider. I added checking if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck (15) as it is related to 3 and 4. I included checking if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street (10) and putting a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement (9) as more drastic measures. I added using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor (11) as a more technical solution. I included calling the police every day to report the noise until something is done (12) and taking the truck to the nearest police station and leaving it there (13) as extreme measures. I added using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation (6) as a solution for the sleep disturbance. I included stationary idling being an offense in some places, such as the UK (7) as it is related to 3 and 15. I added consider if the neighbor's older diesel truck may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes (5) as it is related to 4. I added talking to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation (14) as a way to have a civil conversation. I put reporting the neighbor to the police for excessive noise (2) last as it is a more drastic measure and should be considered after other options have been exhausted.\n",

      "REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the neighbor is being inconsiderate but not malicious. Therefore, the first step should be to communicate with the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck (14). If that doesn't work, then it's reasonable to ask them to turn off their truck when it's not in use (1). It's also important to check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (3) and to educate the neighbor about the unnecessary waste of fuel (4) and potential environmental harm (5, 15). If the neighbor continues to idle their truck, then it's appropriate to report them to the authorities (7, 12, 13). However, I think it's better to try other methods first, such as using a noise machine or earplugs (6) or recording the engine noise to make a point (8). Some people may not realize the impact of their actions, so it's important to give them a chance to change before resorting to more drastic measures (9, 11). Finally, I think it's less productive to engage in escalating confrontations (2, 12, 13) or to take matters into one's own hands (9, 11).\n",

I also think it's important to consider if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances (15) and if idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary (5) and a waste of fuel (4).
