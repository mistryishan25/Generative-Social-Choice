REASONING: Based on my comment, I agree that going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay (2). I also think that forcing someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries (3). Sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation (4), and not respecting someone's wishes can make them feel uncomfortable or even stressed (9). I agree that a simple 'thank you' or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation (10). I agree that everyone involved is trying to do the right thing, but some methods are better than others (6), and it's better to be transparent and direct when showing appreciation, rather than sneaky or manipulative (7). Instead of paying for services, consider doing something nice for the person, like taking them out for a meal (5) and making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment (8). I think respecting people's wishes and boundaries, even if it's a kind gesture (1) is less important than the other statements because it's important to consider the other person's feelings and boundaries."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the most liked statement is ""Going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay."" (statement 2) because it directly addresses the issue of secretly paying someone. I also agree with ""Sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation."" (statement 4) and ""Forcing someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries."" (statement 3) because they are related to the action taken by the poster.

I can see why ""Respect people's wishes and boundaries, even if it's a kind gesture."" (statement 1) and ""Not respecting someone's wishes can make them feel uncomfortable or even stressed."" (statement 9) are important, but they are less specific to the situation. Similarly, ""A simple 'thank you' or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation."" (statement 10) and ""It's better to be transparent and direct when showing appreciation, rather than sneaky or manipulative."" (statement 7) are good principles, but they don't stand out as much as the other statements.

I agree with ""Consider making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment."" (statement 8) and ""Instead of paying for services, consider doing something nice for the person, like taking them out for a meal."" (statement 5) because they offer alternative ways to show appreciation. However, they are less directly related to the issue at hand.

Finally, I agree with ""Everyone involved is trying to do the right thing, but some methods are better than others."" (statement 6) because it acknowledges that people are generally well-intentioned, but it doesn't stand out as much as the other statements."

Statement 4, sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation, is a method that I disagree with. Statement 3, forcing someone to accept something they don't want, is also a violation of their boundaries.

I understand you and your dad's thought process, but asking you to slip money into his wallet was not the way to do it. It's overstepping and disrespectful.

First off, you shouldn't be involved AT ALL.  Your dad wants to compensate your boyfriend for tutoring, and your boyfriend feels like he's repaying a debt to your dad for saving his dad's life (or at least giving him health back).  You are not respecting that, and over involving yourself.  Also, don't go through his wallet.

Your dad can thank him and pay him, certainly. Normally, a good way to do this is to give him a card with a gift card in it. (Not sure where you are, or if that's possible).",29,0,,,YTA,,"YTA I understand you and your dad's thought process, but asking you to slip money into his wallet was not the way to do it.

REASONING = Based on my comment, I strongly disagree with the actions of the poster, hence statement 2 (going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay) is the most liked statement. Statement 4 (sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation) is similar to my comment and also strongly agreed upon. Statement 3 (forcing someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries) is also closely related to my comment and is placed third. Statement 1 (respect people's wishes and boundaries, even if it's a kind gesture) and statement 9 (not respecting someone's wishes can make them feel uncomfortable or even stressed) are agreed upon, but less strongly than the previous statements. Statement 6 (everyone involved is trying to do the right thing, but some methods are better than others) and statement 7 (it's better to be transparent and direct when showing appreciation, rather than sneaky or manipulative) are neutral, but still agreed upon. Statement 10 (a simple 'thank you' or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation) is agreed upon, but less strongly than statement 6 and 7. Statement 5 (instead of paying for services, consider doing something nice for the person, like taking them out for a meal) and statement 8 (consider making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment) are least agreed upon, as they do not address the issue of disrespecting boundaries and overstepping."

However, I understand that respecting people's wishes and boundaries is important (1, 2, 3, 9). I also agree that sneaking money into someone's wallet is not the best way to show appreciation (4), and a simple ""thank you"" can be enough (10). I also prefer transparent and direct methods of showing appreciation (7), and I think charitable donations can be a good alternative (8). I understand that everyone is trying to do the right thing (6), but I would still rank the statements that emphasize respecting boundaries higher. I also agree that instead of forcing payment, doing something nice for the person can be a better option (5)."

I agree with statement 10, a simple thank you can be enough. I also agree with statement 7, being transparent and direct is better than sneaky or manipulative. Statement 6 is also reasonable, everyone is trying to do the right thing but some methods are better than others. Statement 1, respecting people's wishes, and statement 9, not respecting someone's wishes can make them uncomfortable, align with my perspective. I disagree with statements 2, 3, and 4, which focus on the negative aspects of the action. Statement 5, making a charitable donation, is a good idea but not directly related to the situation. Statement 8, I would consider this as a better alternative than forcing payment, but it's not the main issue here."

Touching someone else's wallet is not on. It's disrespectful and an invasion of personal space. A nice touch would be a thank you card with a 'loaded gift card' (for a place he'd use/visit) and your brother hands the envelope as a thank you, at an appropriate time interval or to celebrate a certain achievement level.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly disagree with the action of slipping money into someone's wallet (statement 4) and forcing someone to accept something they don't want (statement 3). I agree with respecting people's wishes and boundaries (statement 1), and not going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to (statement 2). 

Furthermore, I believe that being transparent and direct is better than sneaky or manipulative (statement 7), and not respecting someone's wishes can make them feel uncomfortable or even stressed (statement 9). 

I also think that a simple thank you or acknowledgement can be enough (statement 10), and consider making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment (statement 8). 

The other statements (6, 5) are less relevant to my stance, but I still agree with them in the context of this situation."

REASONING = Based on my comment ""Definitely nah"", I believe that slipping money into someone's wallet without their knowledge or consent is not an acceptable way to show appreciation. Therefore, I agree with statements 2, 3, 1, 9, 4, and 10 which express the importance of respecting people's wishes and boundaries, and the negative consequences of violating them. I also agree with statements 7, 6, and 8 which suggest more appropriate and respectful ways to show appreciation. Statement 5, while well-intentioned, seems to miss the point of the situation and is therefore ranked last."

However, I also think that respecting people's wishes and boundaries is important, so I agree with statements 1, 6, 9, and 10. Statement 2 is in disagreement with my comment, so it goes towards the end of the order. Statements 5 and 8, while not directly related to my comment, suggest alternative ways of showing appreciation that are more direct and respectful, so they are placed towards the end of the order."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the boyfriend should not keep the money and should donate it instead. This aligns with statement 2, which states that going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay. Statement 3, which mentions forcing someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries, also supports my stance. Statement 9, which states that not respecting someone's wishes can make them feel uncomfortable or even stressed, further solidifies my position. Statement 1, which mentions respecting people's wishes and boundaries, even if it's a kind gesture, is in line with my reasoning. Statement 4, which states that sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation, is also relevant. Statement 10, which states that a simple 'thank you' or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation, is in line with my comment. Statement 5, which suggests doing something nice for the person, like taking them out for a meal, is not directly related to my comment but still supports the overall theme of showing appreciation without forcing payment. Statement 7, which states that it's better to be transparent and direct when showing appreciation, rather than sneaky or manipulative, aligns with my reasoning. Statement 6, which states that everyone involved is trying to do the right thing, but some methods are better than others, is a neutral statement that doesn't directly relate to my comment.

REASONING: Based on my comment being ""NAH"", I don't think anyone is an asshole in this situation. However, I agree with statements 2 and 3 the most because going behind someone's back and forcing someone to accept something they don't want are clear violations of their boundaries. Statement 1 is similar but less strongly worded, so it comes next. Statement 9 is also related to boundaries and comes after 1. Statements 4 and 10 are about the method of showing appreciation, and I agree more with 4 because sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation. Statement 7 is similar but more general, so it comes after 4. Statement 6 is a more neutral statement that acknowledges everyone is trying to do the right thing, so it comes next. Statement 8 is about making a charitable donation instead of forcing payment, which I agree with but not as much as the previous statements, so it comes after 6. Statement 5 is the least liked statement because it suggests paying for services instead of finding a nicer way to show appreciation, which contradicts my ""NAH"" comment."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the poster is an asshole for slipping money into their boyfriend's wallet without his consent. I agree with statement 2, which says going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay. Statement 3, which says forcing someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries, also aligns with my view.

Statement 4, which says sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation, and statement 10, which says a simple 'thank you' or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation, are both relevant and I agree with them.

REASONING: Based on my comment being ""NAH"", I believe that no one is truly an asshole in this situation. However, there are still some actions that are less preferred than others. I agree with statements 2 and 4 the most, as they directly address the issue of going behind someone's back and sneaking money into their wallet. These actions violate the person's boundaries and wishes, which I ranked as the least liked.

Moving on to statement 3, I agree that forcing someone to accept something they don't want is also a violation of their boundaries. However, I ranked it lower than statements 2 and 4 because the boyfriend did not explicitly say no to receiving the money.

Statement 9 is about making someone feel uncomfortable or stressed by not respecting their wishes. I agree with this statement, but I ranked it lower because the boyfriend did not seem to be overly uncomfortable or stressed in the description.

Statement 1 is about respecting people's wishes and boundaries, which I agree with. However, I ranked it lower because it does not directly address the issue of sneaking money into someone's wallet.

Statement 10 suggests that a simple 'thank you' or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation. I agree with this statement, but I ranked it lower because it does not directly address the issue at hand.

Statement 6 is about everyone involved trying to do the right thing, but some methods are better than others. I agree with this statement, but I ranked it lower because it does not directly address the issue of sneaking money into someone's wallet.

Statement 5 suggests doing something nice for the person instead of forcing payment or compensation. I agree with this statement, but I ranked it lower because it does not directly address the issue of sneaking money into someone's wallet.

Statement 8 suggests making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment. I agree with this statement, but I ranked it lower because it does not directly address the issue of sneaking money into someone's wallet.

Finally, statement 7 suggests being transparent and direct when showing appreciation, rather than sneaky or manipulative. I agree with this statement, but I ranked it the lowest because it does not directly address the issue of sneaking money into someone's wallet."

Sometimes, accepting a small gift of gratitude from someone you were kind to is another act of kindness. If they feel indebted, it can weigh on them, and they may hesitate to ask for help again.

Perhaps if you explain this is how your dad seems to feel, he might be willing to find a happy medium. Lots of people would feel terribly uncomfortable about receiving money as a gift of thanks. But something like your dad taking your boyfriend out for lunch once in awhile, or helping him out with an errand, would be a good way for your dad to feel the slate is clean, your boyfriend's to feel that this is less transactional.

""That my boyfriend shouldn’t feel indebted about it since my dad was more than happy and is still happy about the decision.""

Unfortunately, no matter how much GOOD one can do, there will be those who do good and cannot do good for profit. it violates the moral code and ethic of being good or doing the right thing for the sake of doing the right thing.

I can relate to your BF, as it is MENTALLY PAINFUL to accept money for doing something I DO NOT WANT TO BE PAID FOR. its really as simple as that. I would much, much rather someone say hey dude, thanks for helping. let me buy you lunch. (which is the proposed solution. a  good one i agree with!)

  
You did nothing wrong, i just hope you can understand that FORCING someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries. Even if its silly, and you know he could use the money(not sure if this is the case, more of an example), forcing someone to do something is disrespectful to their ideals. Again, i don't feel you did this with intent, i think you where just trying to do the right thing. 

Also, if your dads saved his dads life, he might be doing this not out of obligation or duty to repay a familial debt, but because he feels its the least he can to do show his gratitude.

For example, if his sole purpose of teaching your brother is some kind of deep seated duty to repay your family for the act of kindness your family blessed his with, you forcing him to accept money he doesn't want is equivalent of him teaching your brother to repay a debt.

In this case, there is no debt(at least from the vibes i get coming from the dads)

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly agree that going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay (statement 2). I also agree with the idea that forcing someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries (statement 3). Sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation (statement 4), and not respecting someone's wishes can make them feel uncomfortable or even stressed (statement 9).

I agree with the statement that a simple ""thank you"" or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation (statement 10), and that it's better to be transparent and direct when showing appreciation (statement 7). I also agree that everyone involved is trying to do the right thing, but some methods are better than others (statement 6).

I slightly agree with the statements that consider making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment (statement 8) and instead of paying for services, consider doing something nice for the person, like taking them out for a meal (statement 5). These statements are less relevant to the situation described in the post, but they still promote positive and respectful behavior.

I disagree with the statement that respecting people's wishes and boundaries, even if it's a kind gesture, is not enough (statement 1). In this situation, respecting the boyfriend's wishes not to accept the money would have been the right thing to do."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the poster is ""marriage material,"" implying that they have good intentions and are thoughtful. However, the act of slipping money into someone's wallet without their knowledge or consent is not an appropriate way to show appreciation. Therefore, I agree with statements 2 and 3, which emphasize respecting people's wishes and boundaries. Statement 1 is also in line with my perspective, as it acknowledges the importance of respecting boundaries, even if the intention is to do something kind.

Statement 9 highlights the potential discomfort or stress that can be caused by not respecting someone's wishes, which aligns with my reasoning. Statement 4 reinforces the idea that sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation, and statement 10 suggests that a simple ""thank you"" can be enough, which I agree with.

Statement 5 suggests an alternative way to show appreciation, which is not directly relevant to the situation but is a valid point. Statement 8 proposes making a charitable donation in someone's honor, which is a good idea but not applicable to the situation. Statement 7 emphasizes the importance of being transparent and direct, which I agree with.

Finally, statement 6 suggests that everyone involved is trying to do the right thing, which is a positive perspective, but I prioritize the importance of respecting boundaries and being transparent and direct."

REASONING = In the comment, I expressed that sometimes ""No"" is a complete sentence and the original poster (OP) is the asshole (YTA) for not respecting their boyfriend's wishes. I agree with statement 2 the most, as it directly addresses going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to. Statement 3 also aligns with my view, as forcing someone to accept something they don't want is a violation of their boundaries. Statement 1 is in line with my opinion, but I rank it lower because it doesn't specifically mention respecting someone's explicit ""No"". Statement 4 is a less appropriate way to show appreciation, but I rank it lower because it doesn't directly address the violation of boundaries. Statement 9 emphasizes the importance of respecting wishes, which I agree with, but I rank it lower because it doesn't specifically mention the violation of boundaries. Statement 10 suggests a simple ""thank you"" as an alternative, which I agree with, but I rank it lower because it doesn't directly address the violation of boundaries. Statement 6 acknowledges that everyone is trying to do the right thing, but I rank it lower because it doesn't specifically mention the violation of boundaries. Statement 7 promotes transparency and directness, which I agree with, but I rank it lower because it doesn't specifically mention the violation of boundaries. Statement 8 suggests a charitable donation, which I agree is a better alternative, but I rank it lower because it doesn't directly address the violation of boundaries. Statement 5, while a nice gesture, is not relevant to the violation of boundaries and I rank it the lowest."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I see all the people involved in this situation as good people, so I agree with statement 6 the most, as it acknowledges that everyone is trying to do the right thing. I also agree with statements 7 and 1, as they emphasize the importance of being transparent and respecting people's wishes. Statement 9 highlights the negative impact of not respecting someone's wishes, which I also agree with. A simple ""thank you"" or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation, which is why I agree with statement 10.

I disagree with statement 2, as it implies that going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay. While I understand the sentiment, I believe that the situation in this post is different.

Statements 3 and 4 are similar in that they both criticize the act of sneaking money into someone's wallet. While I agree that it's not an ideal way to show appreciation, I don't think it's as severe as statements 3 and 4 make it out to be.

Statement 5 suggests an alternative way to show appreciation, but I don't think it's necessary in this situation.

Statement 8 suggests making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment. While I agree that this can be a good alternative, I don't think it's relevant to the situation in this post."

REASONING: Based on the comment, the original poster (OP) is TA (the asshole) for not respecting their boyfriend's wishes and boundaries by sneaking money into his wallet. The most disliked statement is 2, which implies that going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay. This directly contradicts the OP's actions.

Statement 3 is similar to 2, but it focuses on forcing someone to accept something they don't want, which is also what the OP did. Statement 1 is about respecting people's wishes and boundaries, which the OP failed to do.

Statement 4 emphasizes that sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation, which is exactly what the OP did. Statement 9 highlights that not respecting someone's wishes can make them feel uncomfortable or even stressed, which is what the OP's actions led to.

Statement 10 suggests that a simple 'thank you' or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation, which is the opposite of what the OP did. Statement 7 stresses the importance of being transparent and direct when showing appreciation, rather than sneaky or manipulative, which the OP failed to do.

Statement 6 acknowledges that everyone involved is trying to do the right thing, but some methods are better than others, which implies that the OP's method was not the best. Statement 8 suggests making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment, which is a better alternative to what the OP did.

Finally, statement 5 suggests doing something nice for the person, like taking them out for a meal, which is a more thoughtful and considerate way of showing appreciation than what the OP did."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly disagree with the action of slipping money into someone's wallet without their knowledge or consent. This is why statement 3, ""Forcing someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries,"" is ranked first. Statement 2, ""Going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay,"" is ranked second because it also highlights the violation of the person's wishes. Statement 4, ""Sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation,"" is ranked third, as it directly relates to the action in question.

Statement 9, ""Not respecting someone's wishes can make them feel uncomfortable or even stressed,"" is ranked fourth because it emphasizes the importance of respecting boundaries. Statement 1, ""Respect people's wishes and boundaries, even if it's a kind gesture,"" is ranked fifth, as it aligns with my belief that enforced gratitude isn't nice. Statement 10, ""A simple 'thank you' or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation,"" is ranked sixth, as it suggests a more appropriate way to show appreciation.

Statement 6, ""Everyone involved is trying to do the right thing, but some methods are better than others,"" is ranked seventh because it acknowledges the intention behind the action but criticizes the method. Statement 7, ""It's better to be transparent and direct when showing appreciation, rather than sneaky or manipulative,"" is ranked eighth, as it highlights the importance of transparency. Statement 5, 'Instead of paying for services, consider doing something nice for the person, like taking them out for a meal,' is ranked ninth because it offers a more respectful alternative.

Finally, statement 8, ""Consider making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment,"" is ranked tenth because, while it is a respectful alternative, it is not directly related to the situation at hand."

I am a 19 year old first-year college student, who about a week ago, agreed with a group of 5 friends that I'd be interested in living with them next school year. 

Yesterday, we found a place we really liked and talked about how we'd figure out the lease by the end of the week. Today they've decided they want to sign the lease ASAP/by tonight because the landlord explained that the market is competitive and they don't want to lose this nice house... But, reading through the lease has made me realize I don't want to do this financially. 

Even with the 5 of us, this would cost me $750/month or $9k to live there for august 2025-july 2026, not counting utilities... and that is money that could go towards classes (I am paying for school by myself and just came back from a gap year of working. I do not want to take any loans and have a lot of anxieties about going into debt after college because it happened to mom and it still effects her). My family also lives close enough to campus that I can just stay with them without having to pay anything.  

These friends are all from out of town so they need to find a place to stay. I feel like a dick now for saying I don't think I can as soon as they are trying to sign the place, because I definitely could with the money I have saved, but I know I'll regret it in the future. I know I really don't want to, but feel like I have to because they don't have anyone else and they need 5 people.

Right now I am banking on the fact that my parents refuse to co-sign, but I technically wouldn't need them because my credit score is better than the both of them. Do I continue to lie and say that my parents are the reason I can't sign? Most if not all of these places require us to have co-signers because we're so young, but my parents' financial history are so poor they don't think they'd be approved as co-signers

I feel like an asshole because this is causing them a lot of anxiety, but it would be better for my own anxiety in the long run if I stayed at home and saved the money... I don't know how any of them are paying for school, so I feel awkward and kind of like an asshole for suddenly saying I couldn't afford it.

I feel like a dick now for saying I don't think I can as soon as they are trying to sign the place, because I definitely could with the money I have saved, but I know I'll regret it in the future. I know I really don't want to, but feel like I have to because they don't have anyone else and they need 5 people. Right now I am banking on the fact that my parents refuse to co-sign, but I technically wouldn't need them because my credit score is better than the both of them. Do I continue to lie and say that my parents are the reason I can't sign? Most if not all of these places require us to have co-signers because we're so young, but my parents' financial history are so poor they don't think they'd be approved as co-signers I feel like an asshole because this is causing them a lot of anxiety, but it would be better for my own anxiety in the long run if I stayed at home and saved the money... I don't know how any of them are paying for school, so I feel awkward and kind of like an asshole for suddenly saying I couldn't afford it. (How would you/should I go about this without ruining my relationship with these people? I don't want to screw them over but know I will if I pull out, which is what I want to do...)",

Therefore, I put statement 10 (This behavior is a red flag and you should consider ending the relationship.) at the top of the list. Statement 6 (His behavior is not just about money, it's about respect and honesty.) is also highly agreed by me, because it's not only about money, but also about the friend's attitude and values. Statement 9 (You're enabling his behavior by not addressing it directly.) and 8 (He's being cheap and cowardly by not being upfront about his intentions.) are also highly agreed by me, because the OP should not enable the friend's behavior and the friend should be honest and direct. Statement 2 (You should have an open conversation about splitting costs and not play games.) and 5 (You're both adults and should be able to discuss this without playing games.) are agreed by me, because the OP and the friend should have an open conversation about splitting costs. Statement 3 (It's reasonable to split costs 50/50, but his methods are weird.) is agreed by me, because it's reasonable to split costs 50/50. Statement 1 (He's playing games to avoid paying for meals and it's manipulative.) and 7 (You should reevaluate the relationship if he's not willing to have an open conversation.) are a little agreed by me, because the friend is playing games and the OP should reevaluate the relationship. Statement 4 (He's trying to see if you're willing to pay for meals without him asking directly.) is the least agreed by me, because it's not clear if the friend is trying to see if the OP is willing to pay for meals or not."

I agree with statement 1 because the friend is indeed playing games to avoid paying for meals, which is manipulative. Statement 2 aligns with my comment as I suggested having an open conversation about splitting costs. Statement 3 is partially agreeable as splitting costs 50/50 is reasonable, but the friend's methods are weird. I agree with statement 5 that both adults should be able to discuss this without playing games. Statement 9 resonates with me as enabling his behavior by not addressing it directly is not a good approach. Statement 4 is somewhat agreeable, but it seems the friend is not even willing to see if the OP is willing to pay for meals. Statement 8 is partially agreeable as the friend is being cheap, but I believe it's more about respect and honesty. Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, which I find reasonable given the friend's behavior. Lastly, statement 10 is the most extreme and I do not completely agree with it, as it may be too hasty to consider ending the relationship based on this issue alone."

Statement 9, which suggests addressing the issue directly, is also ranked high. Statement 5, which emphasizes open communication, is ranked in the middle. Statements 3 and 2, which suggest splitting costs 50/50 and having an open conversation, are ranked lower because they don't address the underlying disrespect and manipulation. Statement 4, which acknowledges the friend's indirect approach, is ranked lower.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe the friend in question is being irresponsible and manipulative with money. Therefore, statements that highlight his disrespectful behavior and the negative impact on the relationship are ranked higher. Statement 10 is ranked first because it summarizes the overall sentiment of my comment, emphasizing that this behavior is a red flag and the relationship should be reconsidered. Statement 6 follows, as it highlights the respect and honesty aspect of the issue. Statement 9 is ranked third, as it suggests that enabling this behavior by not addressing it directly is also a concern.

Statements 7, 2, and 5 are ranked next, as they emphasize the need for open communication and addressing the issue directly. Statement 1 is ranked last, as it slightly downplays the severity of the situation by attributing it to a game, while I believe the friend's actions are more intentional and disrespectful.

The remaining statements (8 and 4) are ranked lower because they focus on the friend's perceived cheapness, which I believe is a secondary aspect of the issue. Statement 8 is ranked lower than 4 because it uses stronger language, such as ""cowardly,"" which I did not explicitly mention in my comment."

Statement 2 suggests having an open conversation, which I also agree with, so it is fourth. Statement 5 is similar to statement 2, so it is fifth. Statement 3 is reasonable but does not address the friend's manipulative behavior, so it is sixth. Statement 1 is partially correct but does not fully address the friend's behavior, so it is seventh. Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, which I agree with, so it is eighth. Statement 8 calls the friend cheap and cowardly, which I also agree with, but it is last because it does not suggest ending the relationship.

I also agree that both parties should be able to discuss this without playing games (statement 5) and that the friend's methods are weird (statement 3). Statement 1 aligns with my view that the friend is playing games to avoid paying for meals. Statement 2 suggests having an open conversation about splitting costs, which I also agree with, but I put it after statement 1 because the friend's behavior is disrespectful and not just about money. Statement 9 emphasizes the need to address the friend's behavior directly, which I agree with. Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, which I also agree with, but I put it after statement 9 because addressing the behavior directly is a necessary first step. Statement 8 calls the friend cheap and cowardly, which I agree with, but I put it after statement 7 because it's less focused on the solution. Statement 10 is the most extreme statement, suggesting ending the relationship, which I put last because it's a drastic measure that should only be considered after all other options have been exhausted. Statement 4, which suggests that the friend is trying to see if the OP is willing to pay for meals without him asking directly, is the least liked statement because it seems to make excuses for the friend's behavior."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the original poster (OP) is the asshole. The OP has valid concerns about the living arrangement and the landlord's behavior. The slate statements that I agree with the most are those that highlight the importance of respect and honesty in the situation (6, 5, 3). I also agree that playing games is not an effective way to handle the situation (2, 1). However, I strongly disagree with statements that blame the OP for enabling the friend's behavior or that suggest ending the relationship (9, 10). I believe that the friend's behavior is a red flag, but it's not necessarily indicative of a toxic or unfixable relationship (7, 4). Therefore, I have ranked the statements in order of how much I agree with them, starting with the ones I agree with the most and ending with the ones I disagree with the most."

Statement 2, ""You should have an open conversation about splitting costs and not play games,"" and statement 3, ""It's reasonable to split costs 50/50, but his methods are weird,"" both suggest a solution to the problem, but they don't fully capture the disrespectful and dishonest nature of the friend's behavior.

I remember going through this with my friends when I was in college. It's one thing to be looking for a place to live but when you get into the specifics such as rent, utilities, and reading the paperwork, it's okay to change your mind. Around this time, college kids are looking to renew leases, or sign new leases. Yes time is running out but you've come to the realization before, but there's still time to consider other options, plus it sounds like no one has signed a lease yet so you and your friends can find somewhere else to live if you're still considering living with them.",-4,0,,,NTA,,"NTA I remember going through this with my friends when I was in college.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the person is an asshole and both parties should communicate openly. Statement 5 aligns with this the most as it emphasizes the need for open conversation. Statement 2 follows next as it also highlights the importance of communication, but it implies that the OP has been playing games which I don't fully agree with based on the description. Statement 3 is reasonable but his methods are not entirely wrong, so it's lower in the ranking. Statement 9 is about addressing the issue directly, which I agree with, but it's not as important as having an open conversation. Statement 1 is about manipulation, but it's not explicitly stated in the description, so I rank it lower. Statement 6 includes respect and honesty, which I agree with, but it's not the main issue here. Statement 4 implies that the friend is testing the OP, but it's not clear, so I rank it lower. Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, which is a bit extreme based on the description. Statement 8 calls the friend cheap and cowardly, which I don't fully agree with, so it's towards the end of the ranking. Statement 10 is about ending the relationship, which is the most extreme, so it's last in the ranking."

I put statement 5 (You're both adults and should be able to discuss this without playing games.) and 3 (It's reasonable to split costs 50/50, but his methods are weird.) after, as they suggest a more equal distribution of costs.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the husband's behavior is not just about money, but also about respect and honesty (statement 6). I agree with statement 1, which also mentions the husband's manipulative behavior. Statement 5, suggesting that both parties should be able to discuss this without playing games, aligns with my perspective. Statement 3, which mentions the reasonableness of splitting costs 50/50, is something I can agree with, but I find the husband's methods weird. Statement 4, which highlights the husband's intention to test the wife's willingness to pay for meals, is also something I can see happening.

I do not agree with statement 2, which suggests that the wife should have an open conversation about splitting costs, because the husband should be the one to initiate the conversation. Statement 9, which suggests that the wife is enabling the husband's behavior, is not entirely fair, as the husband is the one being manipulative. Statement 8, which calls the husband cheap and cowardly, is a strong statement that I don't fully agree with. Statement 10, which suggests ending the relationship, is an extreme measure that I don't think is warranted based on the information provided."

They went to daycare for 1 day each , after we had the twins because he literally had his hands full.

Right from the first week we agreed on an amount each for “hobby money/fun money “. It was **exactly the same amount** for both of us despite our large income disparity.

We can spend this money how we wish, it’s where birthdays gifts to each other comes from. ALL other money are joint funds for bills, savings , pension etc.

My question to you is; Why do you think *you* deserve hobby money “because you work hard” and think you deserve it, but your wife doesn’t?

Believe me, I worked 16 hour days in the beginning, getting things off the ground, and even with just the one child at the time, I realized that I had the easier deal!  My husband couldn’t take a break unless the baby was sleeping, he was exhausted from constantly being on the lookout for safety issues, choking hazards, making baby food and feeding, playing with our son, reading him stories, walking the floor with him when he was teething, or had cramps. We both did night duty, so we were both tired, but he had no let up. He LOVED being a stay at home papa, but once our younger two started school he was also rather relieved.

He said; “I wouldn’t have missed those years for the world, but I never ever want to do them again”.

Parenting alone with small kids **IS A JOB, and a stressful one at that, why does your job “deserve” a hobby fund but hers not?**

**Your wife deserves money she can save up and blow on a gift for her friend, money she doesn’t have to run the purchase by you first, and get your permission to spend - just as you don’t get her permission to spend your hobby money.**

**If you don’t see that, and clearly you don’t, then it means you don’t see her work, the effort put into the “job” of raising your children of any value. You are effectively saying you don’t even see it as work! If I were your wife would be not just pi@@ed off, I’d feel SO demeaned, so shame on you!**

I also agree with statement 10, suggesting that this behavior is a red flag and might warrant reconsideration of the relationship.

I agree with statement 7, which suggests reevaluating the relationship, but I rank it lower because I believe that addressing the behavior directly should be prioritized before considering ending the relationship.

Therefore, statement 10, which suggests ending the relationship, is the most agreed upon. Statement 6, which highlights the respect and honesty aspect, is also highly agreed upon. Statement 9, which criticizes enabling his behavior, and statement 2, which suggests open communication, are also agreed upon. Statement 5, which emphasizes being adults and discussing things, and statement 3, which agrees with 50/50 cost splitting but dislikes his methods, are somewhat agreed upon. Statement 1, which mentions manipulative games, and statement 8, which calls him cheap and cowardly, are less agreed upon. Statement 4, which speculates his intentions, is the least agreed upon."

Statement 6 is ranked second because the husband's behavior is not just about money, but also about respect and honesty. Statement 7 is ranked third because the relationship should be reevaluated if the husband is not willing to have an open conversation. Statement 9 is ranked fourth because the wife is enabling the husband's behavior by not addressing it directly. Statement 2 is ranked fifth because an open conversation about splitting costs should be had instead of playing games. Statement 3 is ranked sixth because while splitting costs 50/50 is reasonable, the husband's methods are weird. Statement 5 is ranked seventh because both adults should be able to discuss this without playing games. Statement 4 is ranked eighth because the husband is trying to see if the wife is willing to pay for meals without him asking directly. Statement 1 is ranked ninth because the husband is playing games to avoid paying for meals, which is manipulative.

REASONING = Based on my comment, I think the husband is in the wrong and his behavior is a red flag (10). His behavior is not just about money, but also about respect and honesty (6), and this is a major issue that should be addressed in the relationship (7). The wife should not enable this behavior (9), and should consider ending the relationship if the husband is not willing to have an open conversation (10). Both parties should be able to discuss this without playing games (5), and the husband's methods of trying to see if the wife is willing to pay for meals without asking directly are manipulative (1). The husband's behavior is cheap and cowardly (8), and the wife should reevaluate the relationship if he is not willing to have an open conversation (7). I agree that it is reasonable to split costs 50/50 (3), but the husband's methods of trying to do so are not appropriate (1). I also agree that the husband should have an open conversation about splitting costs (2), but this is less of a concern for me than the husband's manipulative and disrespectful behavior (10, 6, 7, 9, 5)."

Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, which is also a serious concern. Statement 9 implies that the wife is enabling the husband's behavior, which I think is a valid point. Statement 2 suggests having an open conversation, which I agree with, but I put it lower because the husband is not being straightforward about his intentions. Statement 5 is similar to statement 2, but it implies that both parties should be able to discuss this, which I think is a valid point. Statement 3 is more neutral, as it acknowledges that splitting costs 50/50 is reasonable, but the husband's methods are weird. Statement 1 implies that the husband is playing games, which I agree with, but I put it lower because it's less critical of the husband's behavior. Statement 8 is also less critical, as it only calls the husband cheap and cowardly. Statement 4 implies that the husband is testing the wife's willingness to pay for meals, which I think is a valid point, but I put it last because it's less critical of the husband's behavior."

I strongly agree with statement 10, which suggests that this behavior is a red flag and the relationship should be reconsidered. Statement 9, stating that the wife is enabling this behavior by not addressing it directly, is also a concern (statement 9).

I agree with statement 1, as the husband's actions can be seen as manipulative and a game to avoid paying for meals. Statement 5, suggesting that both adults should be able to discuss this without playing games, aligns with my view. Statement 3, stating that it's reasonable to split costs 50/50, but his methods are weird, is something I can see as a possibility. Statement 2, suggesting an open conversation about splitting costs, is also a reasonable suggestion. Statement 9, stating that the wife is enabling his behavior by not addressing it directly, is something I can see as a potential issue. Statement 4, stating that the husband is trying to see if the wife is willing to pay for meals without him asking directly, is a possibility but I don't see it as a justification for his actions. Statement 7, suggesting reevaluating the relationship, is a bit extreme based on the information provided. Statement 8, stating that the husband is being cheap and cowardly, is not something I agree with as the issue seems to be more about respect and honesty.

Statement 5 also suggests having an open conversation, but it is less liked because it implies that both parties are at fault. Statement 3 agrees with the idea of splitting costs 50/50, but it is less liked because the husband's methods are weird. Statement 1 highlights the husband's manipulative behavior, which I agree with, but it is less liked because it does not directly address the issue of fun money.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I am questioning the husband's behavior and motives regarding the refusal to let his wife spend his money on her best friend. I am particularly interested in the respect and honesty aspect of the situation. Therefore, I agree with statement 6 the most, which highlights the importance of respect and honesty in the relationship.

Statement 1 also aligns with my perspective, as it suggests that the husband's behavior is manipulative and a game-playing tactic. Statement 3 resonates with me as well, as I believe that splitting costs 50/50 is reasonable, but the husband's methods are questionable.

Statement 5 emphasizes the importance of open communication, which I also value. Statement 9 highlights the wife's role in enabling the husband's behavior, which I also mentioned in my comment.

Statements 2 and 4 suggest that the wife should address the issue directly, which I agree with, but they are not my top priority.

Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, which I also mentioned in my comment, but it is not the most important aspect of the situation for me.

Statement 8 criticizes the husband for being cheap and cowardly, which I do not necessarily agree with, as I do not have enough information about his financial situation or intentions.

Statement 10 suggests ending the relationship, which I find to be an extreme measure based on the information provided. Therefore, it is at the bottom of my list."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe the husband's behavior is a red flag and disrespectful, so I put statement 10 (This behavior is a red flag and you should consider ending the relationship.) at the top. Statement 6 (His behavior is not just about money, it's about respect and honesty.) and 7 (You should reevaluate the relationship if he's not willing to have an open conversation.) are also in line with my view, so they are ranked high. Statement 5 (You're both adults and should be able to discuss this without playing games.) is a reasonable expectation, so it's ranked high as well. Statements 9 (You're enabling his behavior by not addressing it directly.) and 2 (You should have an open conversation about splitting costs and not play games.) are similar in nature, but I put 9 before 2 because it's more critical of the wife's behavior. Statement 3 (It's reasonable to split costs 50/50, but his methods are weird.) and 4 (He's trying to see if you're willing to pay for meals without him asking directly.) are less critical, so they're ranked lower. Statement 8 (He's being cheap and cowardly by not being upfront about his intentions.) is similar to statement 1, but less severe, so it's ranked lower. Statement 1 (He's playing games to avoid paying for meals and it's manipulative.) is ranked last because it's the least critical statement in the slate."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe the husband's behavior is a red flag and the wife should consider ending the relationship (10). His behavior is not just about money, it's about respect and honesty (6), and this is a major issue that could indicate deeper problems in the relationship (7). The wife should reevaluate the relationship if the husband is not willing to have an open conversation (7), and she is enabling his behavior by not addressing it directly (9). I agree that both parties should be able to discuss costs openly (5, 2), but the husband's manipulative and cowardly behavior (1, 6, 8) is the most concerning issue. The husband's methods of testing the wife's willingness to pay for meals without asking directly (4) are also problematic, and his behavior is not reasonable (3)."

REASONING = Based on the comment, it is clear that the husband's behavior is a major issue in the relationship. Statement 10, which suggests ending the relationship, is the most agreed upon statement. Statement 6, which highlights the respect and honesty aspect, is also highly agreed upon. Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, which is also a logical conclusion. Statement 9 implies enabling the behavior, which is a valid point. Statement 5 suggests discussing the issue, which is a reasonable approach. Statement 2 suggests having an open conversation, which is a good idea but less preferred than discussing the issue directly. Statement 3 implies that splitting costs 50/50 is reasonable, but the husband's methods are not. Statement 1 implies that the husband is playing games, which is agreed upon but less severe than other statements. Statement 8 implies that the husband is being cheap, which is a valid point but less severe than other statements. Statement 4 implies that the husband is testing the wife's willingness to pay for meals, which is a less severe issue compared to other statements."

I also agree that the partner's methods for splitting costs are weird (statement 3) and that he is trying to see if the OP is willing to pay for meals without asking directly (statement 4). However, I believe that the OP and their partner should be able to have an open conversation about splitting costs (statement 2) and that the OP should not enable the behavior by not addressing it directly (statement 9). I think that statement 1 (he's playing games to avoid paying for meals and it's manipulative) is the least liked because it is not as serious as the other statements and it is not as directly related to the issues in the relationship."

Statement 2, ""Well, you should have an open conversation about splitting costs and not play games,"" and statement 7, ""You should reevaluate the relationship if he's not willing to have an open conversation,"" both suggest solutions for the situation. Statement 10, ""This behavior is a red flag and you should consider ending the relationship,"" is the least liked statement because it suggests a drastic solution without fully understanding the dynamics of the relationship. Statement 8, ""He's being cheap and cowardly by not being upfront about his intentions,"" is also less liked because it oversimplifies the situation and focuses solely on the husband's financial behavior."

I have 0 problem paying for food after he has paid for the previous meal but he doesn’t even let me offer and imposes a sort of avoidable situation at me as to why he can’t pay for the particular meal and i have to pay for it.

then after 3 hours, he said “babe you’ll have to order food today, i’m out of energy”, i expected that from a mile away. and he was fully expecting me to pay for his $30 each burger when he came up with that lame excuse. to test that theory out, i said “im tired too, not in the mood to eat”. lie. right after i said that, he was literally not the same person anymore. he was full of energy and even told me to stay awake, “the night has just started”.

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe the boyfriend's behavior is a red flag and disrespectful, so I agree with statements 10, 6, 7, 9, which strongly criticize his actions. Statement 2 suggests having an open conversation, which I agree with but place lower because the boyfriend's behavior indicates he may not be willing to have a reasonable discussion. Statements 5, 3, and 4 imply that both parties should discuss and split costs fairly, which I agree with but place lower because the boyfriend's actions are more concerning. Statement 1 is the least liked because it downplays the boyfriend's manipulative behavior by focusing only on his attempts to avoid paying."

Statement 3 is ranked sixth because it acknowledges that splitting costs 50/50 is reasonable, but his methods are not. Statement 9 is ranked seventh because it suggests that the OP is enabling his behavior, which is true. Statement 1 is ranked eighth because it identifies his behavior as manipulative, which is a valid point.

Statement 4 highlights the boyfriend's intentions, but I don't think it's the most important aspect of the situation. Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, but I don't think it's necessary at this point. Statement 10 is the most extreme statement and I don't believe it's warranted based on the information provided.

REASONING: Based on the comment, the boyfriend's behavior is not just about money, but also about respect and honesty (statement 6). The boyfriend's actions are manipulative and a red flag, which could lead to ending the relationship (statements 1 and 10). The OP should address the issue directly and reevaluate the relationship if necessary (statements 9 and 7). Both parties should have an open conversation without playing games (statements 2, 5, and 9). The boyfriend's behavior is not only cheap, but also cowardly (statement 8). The OP is enabling the behavior by not addressing it directly (statement 4). The statements are ordered from most agreed upon (6) to least agreed upon (8) based on the comment and slate."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that both the OP and her boyfriend are acting immaturely and disrespectfully. Therefore, statement 10, which suggests ending the relationship due to this behavior, is ranked the highest. Statement 6, which highlights the issue of respect and honesty, is also highly ranked. Statement 7, which advises reevaluating the relationship, is ranked similarly. Statement 5, which emphasizes the importance of open communication, is ranked next, followed by statement 9, which suggests that the OP is enabling her boyfriend's behavior. Statement 2, which recommends having an open conversation about splitting costs, is ranked lower because it does not address the underlying issues of respect and communication. Statement 3, which acknowledges the reasonableness of splitting costs 50/50, is ranked similarly. Statement 4, which speculates about the boyfriend's intentions, is ranked lower. Statement 1, which labels the boyfriend's behavior as manipulative, is ranked last because it oversimplifies the issue and does not acknowledge the OP's role in enabling the behavior. Statement 8, which calls the boyfriend cheap and cowardly, is also ranked last because it is overly critical and does not contribute to a productive conversation."

I strongly agree with statement 10 as it highlights the red flag behavior. Statement 7 also aligns with my comment, emphasizing the need to reevaluate the relationship. Statement 6 highlights the respect and honesty aspect, which I also mentioned in my comment. I agree with statement 9, as enabling the behavior is not a good sign. Statements 5, 3, and 2 suggest having an open conversation, which I agree with but to a lesser extent, as the boyfriend's methods are manipulative and not straightforward. Statement 1 highlights the manipulative aspect, which I agree with. Statement 8 points out the boyfriend's cheapness, which I also mentioned in my comment, but I rank it lower as it is not the main concern. Statement 4, while reasonable, is ranked last as it does not address the manipulative and disrespectful behavior."

Therefore, I agree with statements 5, 6, 7, and 10, which emphasize the importance of open communication and addressing issues directly. I also agree with statements 2 and 3, which suggest that playing games and being cheap are not appropriate ways to handle financial matters. However, I disagree with statement 1, which implies that the boyfriend's behavior is manipulative, as there is not enough information in the post to support this claim. I also disagree with statements 4 and 8, which suggest that the boyfriend is being cheap and cowardly, as these statements are judgmental and do not contribute to a productive conversation. Finally, I ranked statement 9 last because it implies that the OP is enabling the boyfriend's behavior, which is not necessarily true, as the OP may not have realized the implications of their actions until reading the comments."

Statement 3 (It's reasonable to split costs 50/50, but his methods are weird.) and statement 4 (He's trying to see if you're willing to pay for meals without him asking directly.) are ranked lower because they are less critical of the boyfriend's behavior. Statement 5 (You're both adults and should be able to discuss this without playing games.) and statement 9 (You're enabling his behavior by not addressing it directly.) are ranked low because they suggest that the problem can be solved through communication, which I do not believe is the case given the red flags I have identified. Statement 2 (Well, you should have an open conversation about splitting costs and not play games.) is ranked the lowest because it implies that the problem is simply a lack of communication, which I do not believe is the case. Statement 8 (He's being cheap and cowardly by not being upfront about his intentions.) is ranked low because it focuses on the boyfriend's financial motivations, rather than the disrespect and manipulation I see as the core issue."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't believe the boyfriend is being malicious or trying to avoid paying for meals. However, I do agree that his behavior is about respect and honesty (6), and if he's not willing to have an open conversation about splitting costs (7), it's a red flag (10). I also think that both parties should be able to discuss this without playing games (5), and that the behavior is not just about money (6). I agree that the boyfriend's methods are weird (3), but I don't think he's playing games to avoid paying for meals (1) or being cheap and cowardly (8). I do think that the behavior is a red flag (10), but I don't think the OP should reevaluate the relationship yet (7). I also think that the OP is enabling the behavior by not addressing it directly (9), and that the boyfriend is trying to see if the OP is willing to pay for meals without him asking directly (4). I put the statement ""Well, you're both adults and should be able to discuss this without playing games"" (2) last because I think it's the least important statement, as it's already been said in a more specific way earlier in the list."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe the boyfriend's behavior is a red flag and the OP should consider ending the relationship. I agree with statement 10 the most, followed by statements 6 and 7, which also highlight the disrespectful and manipulative nature of the boyfriend's behavior. Statement 9 suggests that the OP is enabling his behavior, which I also agree with. Statements 2, 5, and 3 suggest that both parties should have an open conversation about splitting costs, but the boyfriend's methods are not appropriate. Statements 1 and 4 acknowledge the boyfriend's manipulative behavior, but I believe the situation is more severe and requires a stronger response. Statement 8 criticizes the boyfriend for being cheap, but I think the issue goes beyond just money and is about respect and honesty."

Statement 6 aligns with my view that his behavior is about respect and honesty, not just money. Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, which I agree with. Statement 9 implies enabling his behavior, which I also agree with. Statement 2 suggests having an open conversation, but the boyfriend is manipulative and not willing to have an open conversation, so it's lower in the ranking. Statement 5 suggests both adults should be able to discuss this, which is ideal but not the case here. Statement 3 is reasonable but not fully addressing the issue. Statement 4 is close to statement 1 but less direct. Statement 1 is the least liked because it implies playing games, which is not the main issue here. Statement 8 is about him being cheap and cowardly, which is true but less important than the respect and honesty aspect."

Statement 4 implies that he's trying to see if the OP is willing to pay for meals without him asking directly, which I don't fully agree with as I think he's being more manipulative than that.

Statements 2, 5, and 3 are ranked lower as they suggest having a conversation about splitting costs, which is a reasonable expectation but does not address the underlying disrespectful behavior. Statement 1 is ranked low as it implies the boyfriend is intentionally playing games to avoid paying for meals, which is a serious concern. Statement 4 is ranked last as it suggests the boyfriend is testing the OP, which is less concerning than the other statements.

Statement 7 focuses on the development of a growth mindset, which is a positive outcome of redoing assignments. Statement 6 emphasizes the importance of helping the child learn from their mistakes, which is in line with my comment. Statement 10 highlights the potential for redoing assignments to develop personal responsibility and accountability, which is also in line with my comment.

Statement 9 emphasizes the importance of understanding why the child made mistakes, which is not directly opposed to my comment but places less emphasis on the importance of redoing assignments.

The fourth statement also aligns with my perspective, as the child might not have understood the assignment or the material, and redoing it can help them learn. The third statement is in line with my comment, where redoing the assignment can be seen as a way to teach the child to take responsibility for their work, but it can also be presented as a punishment. The second statement is something I can agree with, as the goal of education is not just to complete assignments, but to understand the material. The seventh statement resonates with my view, as redoing the assignment can help the child develop a growth mindset and learn from their failures. The tenth statement is in line with my perspective, as redoing the assignment can be a way to help the child develop a sense of personal responsibility and accountability for their work. The sixth statement is in line with my opinion, as the focus should be on helping the child learn from their mistakes, rather than just redoing the assignment. The fifth statement, while positive, is not as important as the others, as the child's decision to redo the assignment on their own shows maturity, but it is not necessary for the child's learning. The ninth statement is not a priority for me, as understanding why the child made mistakes is important, but it is not as crucial as helping them learn from their mistakes. The eighth statement is the least important, as the child's teacher may not have required them to redo the assignment, so it's not necessary for the parents to enforce it."

Redoing the assignment can be a way to help them learn (4, 1), but it's not necessary if the teacher didn't require it (8). The focus should be on helping the child learn, rather than just redoing the assignment (2). If the child chose to redo the assignment on their own, it shows maturity and a desire to learn (5), but forcing them to redo it can be seen as punishment (3). The goal of education is to understand the material (2), and redoing the assignment can help with that (1, 4, 7). Personal responsibility and accountability for their work are important for the child to develop (10)."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that forcing the child to redo the assignment is not an appropriate consequence, and it can be damaging to their perception of the value of their time and the fairness of consequences. I do agree that redoing an assignment can help a child learn from their mistakes and understand the material better, but I think it should be the child's decision to do so, not the parents'. I also think that it is important for the parents to understand why the child made mistakes in the first place, rather than just making them redo the assignment. Therefore, I have ranked statement 3 (Forcing a child to redo an assignment can be seen as punishment, but it can also be a way to teach them to take responsibility for their work) as the most liked, because it aligns with my belief that forcing the child to redo the assignment can be seen as punishment. I have ranked statement 4 (It's possible that the child didn't understand the assignment or the material, and redoing it can help them learn) as the second most liked, because it acknowledges the potential benefits of redoing the assignment. I have ranked statement 7 (Redoing the assignment can help the child develop a growth mindset and learn from their failures) as the third most liked, because it highlights the potential for personal growth that can come from redoing the assignment. I have ranked statement 6 (The focus should be on helping the child learn from their mistakes, rather than just redoing the assignment) as the fourth most liked, because it emphasizes the importance of learning from mistakes. I have ranked statement 1 (Redoing poor work helps children learn from mistakes and understand concepts) as the fifth most liked, because it aligns with the potential benefits of redoing the assignment. I have ranked statement 2 (The goal of education is not just to complete assignments, but to understand the material) as the sixth most liked, because it highlights the importance of understanding the material, rather than just completing assignments. I have ranked statement 5 (The child's decision to redo the assignment on their own, despite their father's help, shows maturity and a desire to learn) as the seventh most liked, because it acknowledges the child's autonomy and desire to learn. I have ranked statement 10 (The parents should try to understand why the child made mistakes in the first place, rather than just making them redo the assignment) as the eighth most liked, because it emphasizes the importance of understanding the root cause of the child's mistakes. I have ranked statement 9 (Redoing the assignment can be a way to help the child develop a sense of personal responsibility and accountability for their work) as the ninth most liked, because it suggests that redoing the assignment can be a way to teach the child responsibility, but I think it should be the child's decision to redo the assignment. I have ranked statement 8 (The child's teacher may not have required them to redo the assignment, so it's not necessary for the parents to enforce it) as the least liked, because it implies that the parents are overstepping their boundaries by enforcing the redoing of the assignment."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the child should do their own homework and learn from their mistakes. This aligns with statement 3, which suggests that redoing an assignment can teach a child to take responsibility for their work. Statement 4 also aligns with this idea, as it suggests that redoing the assignment can help the child learn the material. Statement 1 reinforces the idea that redoing poor work can help children learn from their mistakes. Statement 2, while not directly related to my comment, is still in line with the overall goal of education.

Statements 6 and 7 are also in line with my comment, as they suggest that redoing the assignment can help the child learn from their failures and develop a growth mindset. Statement 5, while not directly related to my comment, still promotes the idea of the child taking responsibility for their work. Statement 10 is in line with my comment as it suggests that redoing the assignment can help the child develop a sense of personal responsibility and accountability for their work.

Statement 9, while not directly related to my comment, suggests that the parents should try to understand why the child made mistakes in the first place. This is a good point, but it is not the focus of my comment. Statement 8, on the other hand, is not in line with my comment as it suggests that the child's teacher may not have required them to redo the assignment, so it's not necessary for the parents to enforce it.

In summary, I agree with statements that align with the idea of the child doing their own homework, learning from their mistakes, and taking responsibility for their work. I disagree with statements that suggest that redoing the assignment is not necessary or that the focus should be on understanding why the child made mistakes rather than making them redo the assignment."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I agree that the parents are not the asshole for making their son redo the assignment. I also agree that redoing the assignment can help the child learn from their mistakes, understand the material, and develop a growth mindset (1, 4, 6, 7). Additionally, I think that it can help the child take responsibility for their work and develop a sense of personal accountability (3, 10). However, I disagree with the idea that forcing the child to redo the assignment can be seen as punishment (2). Instead, the focus should be on helping the child learn from their mistakes and understand the instructions (3, 6, 10). I also think that it's important for the parents to try to understand why the child made mistakes in the first place, rather than just making them redo the assignment (9). The statement about the child's decision to redo the assignment on their own shows maturity, but it's not relevant to the situation since the parents are the ones requiring the child to redo it (5). Finally, I think that whether or not the child's teacher required them to redo the assignment is not relevant to the parents' decision to have the child redo it (8)."

At least, based on my (admittedly possibly overreaching) inferences from one paragraph, of the available options, this best describes you.

So, your husband, who is ""amazing"" at science, ""helped"" your son, but your son, rather than turn in the presumably correct assignment that your husband ""helped"" him on, did a new version by himself and turned that in. Did it occur to you at all to wonder why that is? Why did he ignore a perfectly good project and make an inferior version from scratch? Sounds to me that your son would rather get a poor grade on work that he did himself than get a good grade on something your husband did. That shows maturity on his part, and is a red flag to me as far as you and your husband. 

If your husband's ""help"" results only on your son having a finished output that is good, but doesn't result in your son being able to create a good finished output on his own, then how exactly is your husband helping him? The purpose of homework isn't the output, it's the learning. You've been in education for 20 years and you don't understand that?

What exactly do you think redoing it will involve? Do you think he deliberately did a poor job, and he will somehow magically do a better job the next time if you just ask him to do it again? Do you think telling him that what he did wasn't right will somehow make him know what \*is\* right? My guess is he's just going to feel pressured to copy the version that his dad ""helped"" him on so you can pretend that he's actually learning.

You really need to take a good hard look at how you and your husband are approaching your son's education. Your son is not learning the subject matter, and rather than addressing that, you are addressing the symptoms. Your post doesn't have any discussion of what you're doing to try to figure out why your son isn't learning, or trying to figure out how to address the fact that he isn't learning.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I agree that redoing the assignment is not a negative action and can be helpful for the child's learning. Therefore, I put statement 1 (Redoing poor work helps children learn from mistakes and understand concepts.) as the most liked. Statement 3 (Forcing a child to redo an assignment can be seen as punishment, but it can also be a way to teach them to take responsibility for their work.) and statement 4 (It's possible that the child didn't understand the assignment or the material, and redoing it can help them learn.) are also in line with my perspective, so I put them next. Statement 2 (The goal of education is not just to complete assignments, but to understand the material.) is not in direct opposition to my viewpoint, but I prioritize the practical aspect of learning from mistakes over the theoretical goal of education. Therefore, I put it after the previous statements. Statement 7 (Redoing the assignment can help the child develop a growth mindset and learn from their failures.) and statement 6 (The focus should be on helping the child learn from their mistakes, rather than just redoing the assignment.) are similar to statement 1, so I put them next. Statement 10 (Redoing the assignment can be a way to help the child develop a sense of personal responsibility and accountability for their work.) is also in line with my perspective, so I put it after the previous statements. Statement 5 (The child's decision to redo the assignment on their own, despite their father's help, shows maturity and a desire to learn.) is not directly related to my perspective, so I put it after the previous statements. Statement 9 (The parents should try to understand why the child made mistakes in the first place, rather than just making them redo the assignment.) is not in direct opposition to my perspective, but I prioritize the practical aspect of learning from mistakes over understanding the root cause of the mistakes. Therefore, I put it after the previous statements. Statement 8 (The child's teacher may not have required them to redo the assignment, so it's not necessary for the parents to enforce it.) is the least liked statement because it implies that the parents should not intervene in the child's learning process, which contradicts my perspective that redoing the assignment can be helpful for the child's learning."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that redoing the assignment can be beneficial for the child's learning and development. Statement 1 aligns with this belief, as it highlights the importance of learning from mistakes. Statement 2 also aligns with this belief, as it emphasizes the importance of understanding the material rather than just completing assignments. Statement 4 reinforces the idea that redoing the assignment can help the child learn. Statement 3 and 7 emphasize the importance of personal responsibility and accountability, which I also believe is important. Statement 6 focuses on helping the child learn from their mistakes, which I agree with. Statement 5, while positive, is less relevant to the importance of redoing the assignment. Statement 10, while also positive, is less important than the other statements. Statement 9 focuses on understanding why the child made mistakes, which is important but not as important as the other statements. Statement 8 is the least important, as it suggests that redoing the assignment may not be necessary if the teacher did not require it."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that it's important for children to take responsibility for their work and learn from their mistakes. Therefore, I agree with statement 3, ""Forcing a child to redo an assignment can be seen as punishment, but it can also be a way to teach them to take responsibility for their work."" I also agree with statement 10, ""The parents should try to understand why the child made mistakes in the first place, rather than just making them redo the assignment,"" because understanding the root cause of the mistakes can help the child learn better.

Statement 4, ""It's possible that the child didn't understand the assignment or the material, and redoing it can help them learn,"" aligns with my belief that redoing the assignment can help the child learn from their mistakes and understand the material better. Statement 1, ""Redoing poor work helps children learn from mistakes and understand concepts,"" and statement 7, ""Redoing the assignment can help the child develop a growth mindset and learn from their failures,"" also reflect this belief.

Statement 6, ""The focus should be on helping the child learn from their mistakes, rather than just redoing the assignment,"" is in line with my comment, as the goal is to help the child learn and grow. Statement 2, ""The goal of education is not just to complete assignments, but to understand the material,"" reinforces the importance of learning and understanding over just completing assignments.

Statement 5, ""The child's decision to redo the assignment on their own, despite their father's help, shows maturity and a desire to learn,"" is a positive outcome but not necessarily a requirement for redoing the assignment. Statement 9, ""The child's teacher may not have required them to redo the assignment, so it's not necessary for the parents to enforce it,"" suggests that the decision to redo the assignment should be left to the teacher, which I disagree with based on my belief in personal responsibility and accountability. Statement 8, ""Redoing the assignment can be a way to help the child develop a sense of personal responsibility and accountability for their work,"" aligns with my belief in personal responsibility and accountability, but it is not as strongly stated as statement 3."

However, it's important to understand the underlying reasons for the child's mistakes and focus on helping them learn from their failures (6, 2, 10). Additionally, while redoing the assignment can be beneficial, it should not be seen as a punishment (10). The child's decision to redo the assignment on their own shows maturity, but ultimately, the focus should be on understanding the material rather than just completing assignments (5, 2, 8).

Statement 7 highlights the development of a growth mindset, which I consider important. Similarly, statement 6 focuses on learning from failures, which I also find relevant. Statement 2, while less important, does touch on the idea that completing assignments is not the sole goal of education.

Statement 5, although positive, is less relevant to the situation, so it is placed lower in the order. Statement 10, while not incorrect, is not a primary concern in this scenario, so it is placed towards the end of the order. Statement 9 focuses on understanding the child's mistakes, which is important but less so than the other statements, and is placed accordingly.

Post,1gjy9l8,AITA for opening my husband’s package? ,pplplsrrrr,2024-11-05 04:10:10,"I (28) and my husband (30) just married earlier this year. Since we took our relationship to the next level, we decided to not renew our lease with our roommate and get our own spot. During the past 6 months of living together, just us two and my cat, I mostly get a ton of packages sent to our door. 

Whenever I place orders, especially through Amazon, I always give my husband a heads up. Not for any other reason. Yesterday, I gave him a heads up that I was ordering 3 things for my sibling. I was the first to get home today and noticed 3 packages. I ordered my sibling semi big things, and immediately opened up the boxes to wash before I head their way tonight. Shortly after opening the first box, I noticed a bright color that couldn’t have been what I ordered. I quickly checked the address, it was addressed to my husband, and I set it aside and continued to open the other 2 boxes. Somehow Amazon figured out a way to condense my order only into 2 packages. I thought nothing of it. 
My husband and I then had our daily ‘after-work’ phone call, where we discuss what happened throughout our days and he quickly threw out that he should have a package waiting for him. I then told him I accidentally opened it, but set it aside for him to completely open when he got home. 

The conversation then took a turn when he began to scold me about opening his packages. I reminded him of my order and explained to him that it wasn’t intentional. That I was just expecting my orders for my sibling and wanted to prepare their stuff before I gave it to them later. This explanation wasn’t good enough. 

My husband made it seem that I was being negligent, and that “common sense is to look at the address before opening any package or mail”. Although I agree with this, I don’t feel like it’s necessary when the packages are delivered to OUR door. I was expecting the package and opened it because I thought it was mine. I also feel since we are married, it shouldn’t matter that I opened the package on accident. It’s not like I took everything out. I simply took my key swiped it across the tape and noticed it wasn’t mine, and set it aside. 

After arguing in circles, his solution was for me to check every label before opening anything and my solution is a heads up after placing an order. I told him I’ll work on looking at the label, but he thinks it’s unnecessary to tell me when he’s expecting a package. We left the conversation annoyed at each other.

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable and it's how you respond that matters (5). Communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail (9) and checking the label before opening a package to avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy (1) are important, but I also think it's common sense to check the label even if the package is delivered to your home (2) and respecting each other's space and privacy is important in a relationship, even when it comes to packages (6). If you're expecting a package, it's best to communicate with your partner to avoid confusion (4) and if you're not sure who a package belongs to, it's best to set it aside and ask your partner before opening it (8). Marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages (3) and it's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation (10). I also think that it's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake (7) and the most that has happened in my experience is the opener says ""oops, sorry"" and the other one says ""that's okay"" and we move on (5)."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly agree that marriage doesn't mean having access to your partner's private mail and packages (statement 3). I also believe that respecting each other's space and privacy is important in a relationship, even when it comes to packages (statement 6), and communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail (statement 9). I agree that it's common sense to check the label before opening a package (statement 2) and that checking the label is necessary to respect the recipient's privacy (statement 1). I also think that if you're not sure who a package belongs to, it's best to set it aside and ask your partner before opening it (statement 8). I agree that opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable, but it's how you respond that matters (statement 5), and that it's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake (statement 7). I think it's best to communicate with your partner if you're expecting a package (statement 4), but I also believe that it's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation (statement 10)."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that both the OP and her husband are in the wrong for not respecting each other's privacy. Therefore, statement 3 (Marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages.) is the most agreed upon statement. Statement 6 (Respecting each other's space and privacy is important in a relationship, even when it comes to packages.) and 9 (Communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail.) are also highly agreed upon as they reflect the importance of communication and respect in a relationship. Statement 1 (Check the label before opening a package to avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy.) and 8 (If you're not sure who a package belongs to, it's best to set it aside and ask your partner before opening it.) are also agreed upon as they provide practical solutions to avoid opening someone else's package by mistake. Statement 5 (Opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable, but it's how you respond that matters.) is agreed upon as it highlights the importance of the response after a mistake is made. Statement 4 (If you're expecting a package, it's best to communicate with your partner to avoid confusion.) is agreed upon as it promotes communication. Statement 2 (It's common sense to check the label, even if the package is delivered to your home.) is agreed upon but to a lesser extent as it assumes common sense. Statement 7 (It's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake, but it's how you handle the situation that matters.) is agreed upon but it is less important than the other statements. Statement 10 (It's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, and it's how you respond that can make or break the relationship.) is the least agreed upon as it implies that one of the parties is overreacting."

I see all your comments. I understand that opening his package was wrong. I forgot to mention as part of the conversation, first thing I did was apologize.

Just set it aside for me, and he likes to open his own packages, which I totally get. I can’t stress enough that it was just a simple mistake. I didn’t read the label because I really thought it was mine. 

I do not open his packages on purpose or regularly. I don’t go through his phone. I don’t go into the bathroom when he’s shitting. Whatever else, I respect him and his privacy. 

A lot of you think I intentionally opened his package without remorse and just said fuck it. I can do what I want. We’re married.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the most important statement is that marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages (statement 3). This is because I mentioned in my comment that the husband was in the wrong for flipping out on the poster for opening his package, but also stated that it's common courtesy not to open someone else's mail. Statement 6, ""Respecting each other's space and privacy is important in a relationship, even when it comes to packages,"" aligns with this belief.

I also think it's common sense to check the label before opening a package (statement 1) and that it's a best practice to communicate with your partner if you're expecting a package (statement 4). These statements are important because they can help avoid confusion and mistakes in the first place.

Statement 10, ""It's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, and it's how you respond that can make or break the relationship,"" is important because it highlights the importance of how you respond to a situation.

Communication and mutual respect are crucial in avoiding conflicts, as stated in 9, which also supports my stance.

Statement 4, suggesting communication when expecting a package, is reasonable but less crucial than the aforementioned points. Statements 5 and 8, about setting the package aside and asking before opening, are valid suggestions but less critical than the main idea of respecting privacy. Statements 7 and 10, suggesting not to make a big deal or overreact, seem to downplay the significance of the violation of privacy and are thus ranked lower."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that the most important statement is that marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages (3). This is because the poster showed a lack of respect for their husband's privacy by opening his package without his consent. I also think that it is important to respect each other's space and privacy in a relationship (6), and that checking the label before opening a package is a simple way to avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy (1). I agree that it is common sense to check the label, even if the package is delivered to your home (2), and that communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail (9). I believe that it is not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake, but it is how you handle the situation that matters (7), and that if you're not sure who a package belongs to, it's best to set it aside and ask your partner before opening it (8). I also think that it's how you respond that matters, not just making an honest mistake (5), and that it's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation (10). I agree that if you're expecting a package, it's best to communicate with your partner to avoid confusion (4), but I rank it lower because it is less directly related to the poster's actions. I rank the statement that opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable (5) lower because it seems to downplay the importance of the invasion of privacy."

OP for not respecting her husband's opinion when he expressed what he wanted to happen. And as far as Amazon condensing the packages,  they tell tou they will do that when you check out. It says something like ""ship together to reduce trips to your house "".
Also, if OP haD looked at the name on the address prior to just opening the boxes she wouldve seen it was to him. If she wanted to know what he ordered she could've just set the package aside and asked him later what it was. 
My husband and I had seperate amazon accounts. We would tell each other when we expected a package. But we knew not to ask what it was unless it was already something we prior discussed before purchasing. i knew my husband ordered gifts for me from amazon. So I wouldnt open his packsges. Its a respect thing. 

And Husband for making a bigger deal out of it than necessary and scolding OP. All he had to do was say ""please just make sure you are opening the right package"" but I'm wondering if he actually scolded OP because of how OP treated it like it wasn't a big deal and seems to be offended that he was even upset. As women, we always want our spouses to respect our emotions. How about we respect our husband's emotions as well? All OP had to do was apologize for opening the package. Then both needed to discuss a plan for when more packages arrive instead of getting upset. 

OP says ""My husband made it seem that I was being negligent, and that “common sense is to look at the address before opening any package or mail”. Although I agree with this, I don’t feel like it’s necessary when the packages are delivered to OUR door.""

It IS common sense to look at the address before opening packages. What if the package was wrongly delivered? Like a neighbors package? GPS gets my address and my neighbors address wrong all the time. And a lot of times Amazon delivers her packages to my door. Even if she leaves instructions. Lol. 

 And OP agreeing with her statement to check the address, but then commenting like its not a big deal to check them is dismissing how her husband feels. 

""I also feel since we are married, it shouldn’t matter that I opened the package on accident.""

Again OP not respecting her husbands feelings on the matter. If it is a big deal to him then it needs to be a big deal to her and not just be dismissed. Accidents happen but it could've been avoided if she used common sense and had respect for her husband. 

""his solution was for me to check every label before opening anything and my solution is a heads up after placing an order. I told him I’ll work on looking at the label, but he thinks it’s unnecessary to tell me when he’s expecting a package.""

Why should he give a heads up about getting a package when all OP had to do was read the label and set the package aside.

Therefore, statement 1 and 2 are ranked high. Statement 3 emphasizes the importance of respecting each other's space and privacy, which aligns with my comment, so it is ranked next.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that opening someone else's package is a violation of their privacy, even if it was a mistake. Therefore, I agree with statement 3 the most, as it emphasizes the importance of respecting each other's space and privacy in a relationship, especially when it comes to packages. Statement 6 also aligns with my view, as it highlights the significance of respecting each other's privacy.

Statement 9 emphasizes the importance of communication and mutual respect, which I agree with, as it can help avoid conflicts over packages and mail. Statement 1 reinforces the need to check the label before opening a package, which is a common sense practice that I also agree with. Statement 2 further emphasizes the importance of checking the label, even if the package is delivered to your home.

Statement 8 suggests setting aside a package if you're not sure who it belongs to and asking your partner before opening it, which I agree with, as it shows respect for the other person's privacy. Statement 5 highlights that opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable, but it's how you respond that matters, which I agree with, as it's important to take responsibility for your actions.

Statement 4 suggests communicating with your partner if you're expecting a package, which I agree with, as it can help avoid confusion. Statement 7 states that it's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake, but it's how you handle the situation that matters, which I agree with, as it's important to take responsibility for your actions.

Finally, statement 10 suggests that it's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, which I agree with, but I believe that opening someone else's package without their permission is a violation of their privacy, and it's how you respond that matters."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I do not think the poster is TA, so I disagree with statement 3, which says that marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages. I agree with statement 6, which emphasizes the importance of respecting each other's space and privacy in a relationship, even when it comes to packages.

Statement 8, which suggests setting aside a package if you're not sure who it belongs to, is a reasonable approach. Statement 5, which focuses on how you respond after opening someone else's package, is less relevant since the poster opened the package unintentionally.

Statement 4, which recommends communicating with your partner when expecting a package, is less applicable here since the package was already delivered. Statement 2, which implies that opening someone else's package by mistake is not a big deal, contradicts my suggestion that the poster should start opening all of her husband's packages. Statement 7, which states that overreacting to a situation can make or break a relationship, is not directly related to the issue at hand.

Statement 6 is also important because respecting each other's space and privacy is crucial in a relationship. Statement 9 highlights the importance of communication and mutual respect in avoiding conflicts, which I also agree with.

Statements 1 and 2 reinforce the idea that checking the label before opening a package is necessary to avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy. While I agree with this, I prioritize the principle of not opening other people's mail without their consent over the importance of checking the label.

Statement 4 suggests that communicating with your partner about expected packages can help avoid confusion. While I agree that communication is essential, I don't think it's necessary to communicate about every package that might arrive.

Statement 5 highlights that it's understandable to open someone else's package by mistake, but it's how you respond that matters. While I agree that the response is important, I prioritize the initial act of not opening someone else's package without their consent.

Statement 8 suggests setting aside a package if you're not sure who it belongs to and asking your partner before opening it. While I agree that this is a good practice, I think it's less important than the principle of not opening someone else's package without their consent.

Statement 7 emphasizes that it's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake, but it's how you handle the situation that matters. While I agree that the response is important, I prioritize the initial act of not opening someone else's package without their consent.

Common sense dictates checking the label (2), and setting aside a package if unsure (8) are also reasonable actions. Responding appropriately after opening someone else's package by mistake (5) and not making a big deal out of it (7) are important in handling the situation. Lastly, I agree that it's possible to overreact to a situation (10), and it's crucial to respond in a way that can make or break the relationship."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I do not think the poster is an asshole for opening the package, but I do acknowledge that it's important to respect each other's space and privacy in a relationship (statement 3). I also agree that communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail (statement 9). I ranked statement 1 and 4 higher because they suggest ways to avoid making the same mistake in the future. I ranked statement 5 and 8 higher because they suggest that it's not necessary to make a big deal out of the situation, but it's important to handle it appropriately. I ranked statement 2 and 7 lower because they seem to imply that the poster overreacted, which I do not believe is the case based on the information provided. I ranked statement 10 last because it suggests that the poster may be too sensitive, which I do not think is the case based on the information provided."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the original poster (OP) is an asshole for opening their husband's package by mistake. I agree with statements that emphasize understanding and respect in handling the situation, such as statement 5, ""Opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable, but it's how you respond that matters."" I also agree with statement 9, ""Communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail.""

I disagree with statement 3, ""Marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages,"" because I believe that the OP made a mistake and did not intentionally invade their husband's privacy. I also rank statement 10, ""It's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, and it's how you respond that can make or break the relationship,"" last because I don't think the situation calls for a discussion about sensitivity or overreaction.

The rest of the statements fall in the middle of the ranking because they offer general advice about handling packages and mail, but they don't directly apply to the OP's situation. For example, statement 1, ""Check the label before opening a package to avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy,"" is a good practice, but it doesn't address the fact that the OP made an honest mistake. Similarly, statement 8, ""If you're not sure who a package belongs to, it's best to set it aside and ask your partner before opening it,"" is a good suggestion, but it doesn't apply to the OP's situation because they already opened the package.

Overall, I prioritize statements that emphasize understanding and respect in handling the situation, and I rank statements that criticize the OP or offer general advice about handling packages and mail lower."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that opening someone else's package by mistake is not a big deal, but it's important to respect each other's space and privacy in a relationship. Therefore, I agree with statement 3, which emphasizes that marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages. Statement 6 is also in line with my perspective, as it highlights the importance of respecting each other's space and privacy in a relationship. Statement 9 emphasizes the importance of communication and mutual respect in avoiding conflicts, which I also agree with.

Statements 2 and 1 both suggest that it's common sense to check the label before opening a package, which I don't necessarily disagree with, but I don't think it's as important as respecting each other's privacy. Therefore, I rank them lower than statements 3, 6, and 9. Statement 8 suggests setting the package aside and asking your partner before opening it, which is a reasonable approach, but I don't think it's as important as respecting each other's privacy.

Statement 5 suggests that it's understandable to open someone else's package by mistake, but it's how you respond that matters. I agree with this statement, but I rank it lower because I think it's less important than the other statements that emphasize respecting each other's privacy and communication.

Statement 4 suggests that it's best to communicate with your partner to avoid confusion, which I agree with, but I don't think it's as important as the other statements that emphasize respecting each other's privacy and communication.

Statement 7 suggests that it's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake, but it's how you handle the situation that matters. I agree with this statement, but I rank it lower because I think it's less important than the other statements that emphasize respecting each other's privacy and communication.

Statement 10 suggests that it's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, and it's how you respond that can make or break the relationship. While I agree that it's important to respond appropriately, I think it's less important than the other statements that emphasize respecting each other's privacy and communication.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that marriage does not give one partner access to the other's private mail and packages (statement 3). I also think that respecting each other's space and privacy is important in a relationship, even when it comes to packages (statement 6). Communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail (statement 9), which is why I agree with statement 1 about checking the label before opening a package to avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy. Statement 8, about setting aside a package and asking your partner before opening it, is also reasonable. However, I disagree with the idea that it's common sense to check the label (statement 2) or that it's necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake (statement 7). Instead, I believe that it's how you handle the situation that matters (statement 5). Statement 4, about communicating with your partner if you're expecting a package, is less important than the other statements in my opinion.

You  should have checked the label... But you are the A-H for not taking responsibility, and trying to shift the blame onto him. You don't need to check without a 'heads-up' when he orders something.  The fact that you 'don’t feel like it’s necessary when the packages are delivered to OUR door' is immaterial, because your husband disagrees, and it was HIS parcel. You can 'feel' however you want about your OWN parcels. Nowhere does it say you admitted to him that you were wrong or apologized. You just make excuses for why you were not wrong.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly agree with statement 3, which emphasizes that marriage does not mean having access to your partner's private mail and packages. I also agree with statement 6, which highlights the importance of respecting each other's space and privacy in a relationship. Statement 1 is logical, and I agree that checking the label before opening a package can help avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy. Statement 2 aligns with my view that it is common sense to check the label, even if the package is delivered to your home. Statement 4 emphasizes the importance of communication, which I also mentioned in my comment.

I agree with statement 5, which notes that opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable, but it's how you respond that matters. However, I rank it lower because it doesn't directly address the issue of respecting privacy. Statement 8 is similar to statement 1, but I rank it lower because it focuses on setting the package aside instead of checking the label.

Statement 9 emphasizes the importance of communication and mutual respect, which I agree with, but I rank it lower because it doesn't specifically address the issue of privacy. Statement 7 suggests that it's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake, but I rank it lower because it doesn't address the importance of respecting privacy.

Finally, statement 10 suggests that it's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, and it's how you respond that can make or break the relationship.

Therefore, statement 3, ""Marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages,"" is the most agreed upon statement. Statement 6, ""Respecting each other's space and privacy is important in a relationship, even when it comes to packages,"" is also highly agreed upon, as it reinforces the idea that the poster violated her husband's privacy. Statement 1, ""Check the label before opening a package to avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy,"" and statement 2, ""It's common sense to check the label, even if the package is delivered to your home,"" are also agreed upon, as they highlight the importance of checking labels before opening packages. Statement 4, ""If you're expecting a package, it's best to communicate with your partner to avoid confusion,"" is agreed upon to a lesser extent, as it implies that the poster and her husband should have communicated about the package. Statement 5, ""Opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable, but it's how you respond that matters,"" is agreed upon, as it acknowledges that mistakes happen but emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility for those mistakes. Statement 8, ""If you're not sure who a package belongs to, it's best to set it aside and ask your partner before opening it,"" is agreed upon, as it provides a solution for avoiding mistakes in the first place. Statement 9, ""Communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail,"" is agreed upon, as it highlights the importance of communication in a relationship. Statement 10, ""It's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, and it's how you respond that can make or break the relationship,"" is agreed upon to a lesser extent, as it implies that the husband may be overreacting. Statement 7, ""It's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake, but it's how you handle the situation that matters,"" is the least agreed upon, as it implies that the situation is not a big deal, which contradicts my comment."

I believe that it's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, and it's how you respond that can make or break the relationship (statement 10). I disagree with the idea that it's not a big deal to open someone else's package, as it's important to respect their privacy and space (so statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 are ranked lower than the others)."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the poster is the asshole for opening her husband's package without his consent. Therefore, statement 3, which emphasizes that marriage does not mean having access to your partner's private mail and packages, is the most agreed upon statement. Statement 6, which highlights the importance of respecting each other's space and privacy in a relationship, is also highly agreed upon. Statement 9, which emphasizes the importance of communication and mutual respect in avoiding conflicts, is also agreed upon. Statement 1, which advises checking the label before opening a package, is agreed upon but less so than the previous three statements because it does not directly address the issue of privacy. Statement 8, which advises setting aside a package and asking the partner before opening it if unsure, is agreed upon but less so than statement 1 because it assumes that the poster is willing to communicate and respect her husband's privacy. Statement 5, which emphasizes that how one responds to opening someone else's package matters, is agreed upon but less so than statement 8 because it assumes that the poster has already made a mistake. Statement 4, which advises communicating with one's partner to avoid confusion, is agreed upon but less so than statement 5 because it assumes that the poster is willing to communicate. Statement 2, which downplays the significance of checking the label, is agreed upon the least because it does not address the issue of privacy. Statement 7, which suggests that making a big deal out of opening someone else's package is unnecessary, is agreed upon the least because it assumes that the poster has already made a mistake and is overreacting. Statement 10, which suggests that it is possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, is agreed upon the least because it implies that the poster's reaction is unwarranted."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that the situation described in the post did not happen and is fabricated. However, if we were to analyze the statements from a general perspective, I would order them from most liked to least liked as follows:

3: Marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages. - This statement is the most important one as it highlights the importance of privacy and respect in a relationship.

6: Respecting each other's space and privacy is important in a relationship, even when it comes to packages. - This statement reinforces the idea that privacy is crucial in a relationship.

9: Communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail. - Communication is essential in any relationship, and this statement emphasizes its importance in avoiding conflicts.

1: Check the label before opening a package to avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy. - This statement is important as it highlights the need to be careful and respectful when handling other people's packages.

4: If you're expecting a package, it's best to communicate with your partner to avoid confusion. - Communication is essential in avoiding misunderstandings and conflicts.

8: If you're not sure who a package belongs to, it's best to set it aside and ask your partner before opening it. - This statement emphasizes the importance of being cautious and respectful when handling other people's packages.

5: Opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable, but it's how you respond that matters. - This statement highlights the importance of responding appropriately when mistakes are made.

7: It's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake, but it's how you handle the situation that matters. - This statement reinforces the idea that the response to a mistake is more important than the mistake itself.

2: It's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, and it's how you respond that can make or break the relationship. - While this statement is true, it is less important than the others as it focuses on the response rather than the initial action.

10: It's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake. - This statement is the least important one as it downplays the importance of respecting other people's privacy and property."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that marriage does not give one access to their partner's private mail and packages (statement 3). I also think that respecting each other's space and privacy is important in a relationship, even when it comes to packages (statement 6). Communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail (statement 9), which is why checking the label before opening a package is important (statement 1). If there is still confusion about the package, it's best to set it aside and ask your partner before opening it (statement 8). Opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable, but it's how you respond that matters (statement 5). While it's not necessary to make a big deal out of the situation, it's important to respect your partner's privacy (statement 7). Statement 4, which suggests communicating with your partner about expected packages, is also important but comes after checking the label and setting it aside. Statements 2 and 10, which suggest that overreacting to the situation can break the relationship, are the least relevant to my stance."
Post,1gjyyhu,AITA for Not Sharing My Family’s Pasta Sauce Recipe with My Friend?,AreaNo6163,2024-11-05 04:50:05,"

I (28F) have this old family recipe for pasta sauce that’s been passed down for generations. My mom taught me when I was a kid, and over time, it’s become “my thing.” I make it for all sorts of occasions—birthdays, family gatherings, and even just nights in with friends. Everyone raves about it, and I take a lot of pride in keeping it close to the original.

One of my closest friends, Emily, recently asked me for the recipe. She’s been experimenting in the kitchen lately and thought it would be fun to try making it herself. At first, I kind of laughed it off, saying something like, “Oh, maybe I’ll teach you someday,” but she kept pressing. Emily isn’t Italian and doesn’t have a lot of experience cooking from scratch, so I was a little hesitant. It felt weird giving away something that feels so tied to my family, especially since my mom always treated it as a bit of a “family-only” thing.

I tried explaining that it was a family recipe, and I didn’t feel comfortable giving it out. She got pretty annoyed, saying it was just sauce and not some “huge family heirloom.” She pointed out that I’d shared recipes with her before (which is true, but those were random ones I found online, not family recipes).

Now things are awkward between us. She’s been short with me ever since and even made a snarky comment at a dinner party about how I “gatekeep sauce.” A few mutual friends think I should’ve just given it to her to avoid drama, but others understand why I wanted to keep it private.

Family recipes typically stay within the family, passing down from generation to generation.  Having something unique, and getting lots of compliments on it, are the reason they are well kept secrets.  Otherwise, if anyone could get the recipe, it wouldn't hold the same meaning of family pride!

REASONING = Based on my comment, I agree that family recipes are meant to be kept within the family and passed down through generations (1). I also agree that the poster is under no obligation to share their recipe (5, 9), and that saying ""it's a family recipe and I don't feel comfortable sharing it"" should have been the end of the request (5). I also think that if Emily doesn't want to share a recipe, she shouldn't make it for others (9). I disagree with the idea that gatekeeping recipes is petty and immature (3, 10), and that recipes are not intellectual property and should not be treated as such (8). I also think that the comment ""she's not Italian"" was rude and unnecessary (6). I can see how sharing recipes can help spread love and family legacy (7), but I still think that the poster is not obligated to share. I also think that saying no to sharing a recipe is a valid decision that people should respect (5). I understand that some people may see recipe sharing as a way to show love and appreciation (2, 7), but I still think that the poster has the right to keep their recipe private. I also think that the ""drama"" could have been avoided if Emily had not made a big deal about the recipe request (2). I also think that maintaining power and control through recipe gatekeeping is not a valid reason (10). I also think that recipes are meant to be shared and enjoyed, but I still think that family recipes hold a special meaning and should be kept within the family (4)."

Statement 10, ""Gatekeeping recipes can be seen as a way to maintain power and control,"" is a more negative interpretation of the situation, but it's not completely unfounded. Statement 1, ""Family recipes are meant to be kept within the family and passed down through generations,"" is a traditional view, but it doesn't necessarily mean that sharing a recipe is wrong. Statement 7, ""Sharing recipes can help spread love and family legacy,"" is a positive sentiment, but it's not directly relevant to the situation. Statement 8, ""Recipes are not intellectual property and should not be treated as such,"" is a more extreme interpretation of the situation, and it's not necessarily applicable here. Statement 4, ""Recipes are meant to be shared and enjoyed, not hoarded and kept secret,"" is a positive sentiment, but it's not necessarily relevant to the situation.

The ""she's not Italian"" comment was unnecessary and rude (statement 6), and while I believe that recipes should be shared and enjoyed (statement 4), I also recognize that family recipes are meant to be kept within the family (statement 1). I think people should respect the decision not to share a recipe (statement 5), but I also believe that sharing recipes can help spread love and family legacy (statement 7).

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly disagree with the original poster's (OP) decision to gatekeep the family pasta sauce recipe. Therefore, I have ranked statement 3 (Gatekeeping recipes is petty and immature) as the most agreed upon statement, followed by statement 10 (Gatekeeping recipes can be seen as a way to maintain power and control) as the OP's actions can be seen as a power move. Statement 9 (If you don't want to share a recipe, don't make it for others) is ranked next as it is a reasonable alternative to sharing the recipe. Statement 8 (Recipes are not intellectual property and should not be treated as such) is ranked next as it emphasizes the idea that recipes should not be hoarded. Statement 7 (Sharing recipes can help spread love and family legacy) is ranked next as it highlights the positive aspects of sharing recipes. Statement 2 (Sharing recipes is a way to show love and appreciation for others) and statement 4 (Recipes are meant to be shared and enjoyed, not hoarded and kept secret) are ranked next as they align with my belief that sharing recipes is a positive act. Statement 5 (It's okay to say no to sharing a recipe, and people should respect that decision) is ranked next as it is a valid point, but it does not justify the OP's actions. Statement 1 (Family recipes are meant to be kept within the family and passed down through generations) is ranked next as it is the OP's reasoning, but I still disagree with it. Statement 6 (The 'she's not Italian' comment was rude and unnecessary) is ranked last as it is unrelated to the main issue of recipe gatekeeping."

Additionally, if one does not want to share a recipe, they should not make it for others (Statement 9). Statement 1 aligns with my comment as family recipes can hold sentimental value and may not be meant to be shared. Statement 10 also aligns with my comment as gatekeeping recipes can be seen as a way to maintain power and control. Statement 3, while I do not fully agree, can be seen as a valid opinion as some may view withholding a recipe as petty and immature. Statement 6 aligns with my comment as the comment made about the friend not being Italian was rude and unnecessary. Statement 2, 7, and 8, while they promote sharing recipes, I do not fully agree as it is ultimately up to the individual to decide whether or not they want to share their recipe. Statement 4, I disagree with the most as recipes should not be forced to be shared and enjoyed, as it goes against the idea of keeping family recipes private and special."

Statement 5 is also in line with my perspective, as it supports the idea that one has the right to say no to sharing a recipe and people should respect that decision. Statement 9 agrees with my view that if you don't want to share a recipe, you shouldn't make it for others. Statement 3 and 10 are in contrast to my view, but I can see how some people might think that gatekeeping recipes is petty and a way to maintain power and control. Statement 2, 7, and 8 are less aligned with my view, as they suggest that recipes should be shared and enjoyed, and that sharing recipes can help spread love and family legacy. Statement 6 is the least aligned with my view, as it criticizes the comment ""she's not Italian"" which I don't think is relevant to the situation. Statement 4 is the second least aligned with my view, as it suggests that recipes are meant to be shared and enjoyed, not hoarded and kept secret, which goes against my belief that family recipes should be kept within the family."

Therefore, statements 3 and 6, which criticize the OP's behavior, are at the top of my list. Statements 7 and 4, which emphasize the importance of sharing recipes and the positive aspects of doing so, align with my viewpoint and follow closely. Statement 2, which suggests that sharing recipes is a way to show love, is also in line with my perspective. Statement 1, which views family recipes as something to be kept within the family, is less favored by me but still understandable to some extent. Statements 8 and 5, which argue that recipes should be shared and that it's okay to say no, are neutral to me. Statement 9, which suggests not making the recipe for others if you don't want to share it, is less agreeable but still reasonable. Statement 10, which views recipe gatekeeping as a way to maintain power and control, is the least agreeable to me as it seems like an overinterpretation of the situation."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that not sharing a pasta sauce recipe is not a big deal and that the person who posted the question is being overly sensitive. I agree with statement 3, ""Gatekeeping recipes is petty and immature,"" because I think that refusing to share a recipe in this situation is petty. I also agree with statement 7, ""Sharing recipes can help spread love and family legacy,"" because sharing recipes can be a way to share culture and traditions with others.

I partially agree with statement 4, ""Recipes are meant to be shared and enjoyed, not hoarded and kept secret,"" because while I think that sharing recipes can be a good thing, I also think that people should be able to choose whether or not they want to share their personal recipes. However, I disagree with statement 1, ""Family recipes are meant to be kept within the family and passed down through generations,"" because I don't think that recipes should be treated as secret family heirlooms.

I also agree with statement 8, ""Recipes are not intellectual property and should not be treated as such,"" because recipes are generally not protected by copyright law and should not be treated as if they are. I partially agree with statement 2, ""Sharing recipes is a way to show love and appreciation for others,"" because while sharing recipes can be a kind gesture, I don't think it is the only way to show love and appreciation.

I agree with statement 5, ""It's okay to say no to sharing a recipe, and people should respect that decision,"" because I think that the person who posted the question has the right to decide whether or not to share their recipe. I also agree with statement 9, ""If you don't want to share a recipe, don't make it for others,"" because I think that if someone is not willing to share a recipe, they should not make it for others.

I disagree with statement 6, ""The 'she's not Italian' comment was rude and unnecessary,"" because I don't think that the person who posted the question implied that their friend needed to be Italian to enjoy the pasta sauce.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I do not think the original poster (OP) is an asshole for not sharing their family's pasta sauce recipe. Therefore, I agree with statement 5, ""It's okay to say no to sharing a recipe, and people should respect that decision."" I also agree with statement 9, ""If you don't want to share a recipe, don't make it for others,"" because the OP has the right to choose what they want to share.

Statement 6, ""The 'she's not Italian' comment was rude and unnecessary,"" is ranked high because it is unrelated to the main issue of sharing the recipe. However, it is still important to acknowledge that the comment was inappropriate.

Statements 1 and 7, ""Family recipes are meant to be kept within the family and passed down through generations"" and ""Sharing recipes can help spread love and family legacy,"" are ranked high because they highlight the significance of family recipes. However, they do not necessarily mean that the OP is obligated to share their recipe.

Statement 2, ""Sharing recipes is a way to show love and appreciation for others,"" is ranked lower because it assumes that sharing recipes is always the best way to show love and appreciation. In this case, the OP has the right to choose how they want to express their love and appreciation.

Statement 10, ""Gatekeeping recipes can be seen as a way to maintain power and control,"" is ranked lower because it assumes that the OP's decision to not share their recipe is motivated by a desire for power and control. This is not necessarily true, as the OP may have other reasons for not sharing the recipe.

Statement 8, ""Recipes are not intellectual property and should not be treated as such,"" is ranked low because it assumes that the OP is treating the recipe as intellectual property. However, the OP has the right to keep their recipe private, just as they have the right to keep any other personal information private.

Statement 3, ""Gatekeeping recipes is petty and immature,"" is ranked last because it is a subjective judgment that is not necessarily true. The OP's decision to not share their recipe is not necessarily petty or immature, but rather a personal choice.

Statement 4, ""Recipes are meant to be shared and enjoyed, not hoarded and kept secret,"" is ranked last because it assumes that the OP is hoarding or keeping the recipe secret. However, the OP has the right to choose who they want to share the recipe with."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I agree that it is the family's right to keep the recipe private (1, 5). I also think the friend's behavior is weird and unnecessary (6, 9). I support the idea of sharing recipes as a way to show love, but it is not an obligation (2, 7). Recipes are not intellectual property, but they can still be kept private (8, 3). I disagree with the idea that gatekeeping recipes is inherently petty or controlling (4, 10)."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I don't think the original poster (OP) is an asshole for not sharing their family's pasta sauce recipe. Statement 5 aligns with my perspective, as it's okay to say no to sharing a recipe and people should respect that decision. Statement 9 also aligns with my view, suggesting that if the OP doesn't want to share the recipe, they shouldn't make it for others.

Statements 1 and 10 are somewhat agreeable, as they mention the idea of family recipes being kept within the family and not treating recipes as intellectual property. However, they don't fully reflect my stance, as I believe the OP has the right to withhold the recipe.

Statement 6 is partially agreeable, as the comment about the friend not being Italian was unnecessary and potentially contributed to the conflict. However, it doesn't directly relate to the OP's decision not to share the recipe.

Statements 2, 7, and 8 suggest that sharing recipes is a positive action, but they don't consider the possibility that someone might not want to share. I find these statements less agreeable because they don't take into account the OP's perspective.

Statement 3 is the least agreeable, as it labels the OP's actions as petty and immature. I disagree with this characterization, as the OP has the right to choose whether or not to share their family's recipe."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that if the family is not making any money from the recipe, then it is not unreasonable to share it. Therefore, I disagree with statement 1, which suggests that family recipes should be kept within the family. I also strongly agree with statement 8, which states that recipes are not intellectual property and should not be treated as such. I agree with statement 4, which states that recipes are meant to be shared and enjoyed, not hoarded and kept secret. I also agree with statement 7, which states that sharing recipes can help spread love and family legacy. However, I believe that the decision to share a recipe should be respected, so I agree with statement 5, ""It's okay to say no to sharing a recipe, and people should respect that decision."" I also agree with statement 6, ""The 'she's not Italian' comment was rude and unnecessary."" I agree with statement 9, ""If you don't want to share a recipe, don't make it for others."" However, I disagree with statement 3, which states that gatekeeping recipes is petty and immature. I think that if the recipe is not being sold, then it is not unreasonable to keep it within the family. I also disagree with statement 2, which states that sharing recipes is a way to show love and appreciation for others. I think that while sharing recipes can be a way to show love, it is not the only way and it is not necessary to share a recipe to show appreciation for someone. I also disagree with statement 10, ""Gatekeeping recipes can be seen as a way to maintain power and control."" I do not think that keeping a recipe within the family is a way to maintain power and control. Overall, I believe that if the family is not making money from the recipe, then it is not unreasonable to share it, but the decision to share should be respected."

I also agree with statement 1, which states that family recipes are meant to be kept within the family and passed down through generations, as it is the grandmother's recipe. However, I disagree with statement 10, which states that gatekeeping recipes can be seen as a way to maintain power and control, as it is not clear from the post that the recipe holder is doing so with the intention of maintaining power. I also disagree with statement 3, which states that gatekeeping recipes is petty and immature, as it is the decision of the recipe holder to share or not share. I also think that statement 6, which states that the 'she's not Italian' comment was rude and unnecessary, is not relevant to the main question of whether or not it is okay to not share the recipe. I agree with statements 2 and 7, which state that sharing recipes can be a way to show love and appreciation and can help spread love and family legacy, but I think that it is ultimately up to the recipe holder to decide whether or not to share. I also agree with statement 8, which states that recipes are not intellectual property and should not be treated as such, but I think that it is still the decision of the recipe holder to share or not share. I put statement 4 last because it is the most extreme statement, stating that recipes are meant to be shared and enjoyed, not hoarded and kept secret, which I do not think is necessarily true."

I agree with statements that suggest the OP should communicate their plans to their grandmother, but I do not think they need to provide excessive details or give an unreasonable amount of notice.

REASONING: The original poster (OP) is TA because they intentionally misled their friend about the length of their vacation, and they should have been more considerate of their friend's request to keep December and January open. I agree with statement 3 the most because the OP is taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity and then screwing her over by not giving her notice. Statement 9 is also high up because the OP is creating a problem for their grandmother and should take responsibility for their actions. Statement 1 is important because the OP should give their grandmother notice so she can make other arrangements for her house. Statement 6 is also crucial because the OP should let their grandmother know they're moving out as soon as possible. Statement 2 is lower because while the OP should show courtesy and let their grandmother know they're moving out, they don't necessarily need to give her details about their new place. Statement 5 is lower because being ungrateful and entitled is a result of not giving notice, not the primary issue. Statements 4 and 10 are lower because they are less important than giving notice and taking responsibility for one's actions. Statement 8 is last because while giving 30 days' notice is a standard courtesy, it's less important than taking responsibility for the problem the OP is creating for their grandmother.

I agree with statement 3 the most because the OP is indeed acting like a freeloader and taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity. Statement 9 is also high up in the ranking because the OP is creating a problem for their grandmother by not giving her notice and should take responsibility for their actions. Statement 1 is ranked high because the OP should give their grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements for her house. Statement 2 is ranked high because the OP has been living with their grandmother virtually rent-free for 7 years and should show some courtesy by letting her know they're moving out. Statement 5 is ranked high because the OP is being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating their grandmother's kindness and generosity over the years. Statement 4 is ranked lower because while the OP should treat their grandmother like any other landlord, the fact that they have been living with her for free for so long makes this situation different. Statements 6 and 10 are ranked lower because while the OP should let their grandmother know they're moving out and be honest with her, they don't have to give her details about their new place.

REASONING = In the original post, the commentator thought the poster was not the asshole (NTA) for not cancelling their vacation for their best friend's wedding. However, after finding out that the poster had booked a 16-day trip instead of a weekend trip, the commentator changed their stance to YTA (the poster is the asshole). The poster knew about their friend's wedding date and still booked a long trip, showing a lack of consideration for their friend's important day.

I also agree with statements 1 and 2, which suggest that the poster should have given their grandmother notice about their moving out. Statement 5, which mentions the poster's ingratitude and entitlement, is also relevant. Statement 4, which compares the grandmother to a stranger, seems a bit harsh, but it still implies that the poster should have given notice.

Therefore, I agree with statements that highlight the OP's lack of responsibility and gratitude towards their grandmother. Statement 3 is the strongest in expressing this view, followed by statement 9, which emphasizes the problem the OP is creating for their grandmother.

Statement 2 is less strong but still acknowledges the OP's lack of courtesy. Statement 4 and 5 are less relevant to my comment but still imply some level of responsibility towards the grandmother.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the person is taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity and not showing enough courtesy by not giving her notice before moving out. Therefore, I agree with statements 3 and 9 the most, as they highlight the person's irresponsible and entitled behavior. I also agree with statement 5, which points out the person's lack of appreciation for their grandmother's kindness.

Statements 1, 2, and 4 suggest that the person should give their grandmother notice before moving out, which I also agree with. However, I rank them lower than statements 3, 5, and 9 because they don't emphasize the person's lack of gratitude and entitlement as much.

Statement 6 is similar to statement 1, but I rank it higher because it emphasizes the urgency of the situation and the need for the person to take responsibility for their actions.

Statement 10 suggests that the person should be honest with their grandmother but doesn't specify how much notice they should give. I rank it lower because it doesn't address the main issue of the person's lack of consideration for their grandmother.

Statement 8 suggests that the person should give their grandmother 30 days' notice, which I agree with. However, I rank it lower because it doesn't emphasize the person's lack of gratitude and entitlement as much as the other statements.

Finally, statement 7 suggests that the person is not obligated to tell their grandmother about their personal life, which I disagree with. While the person may not be obligated to give details about their new place, they should at least let their grandmother know that they are moving out and not renting her house anymore. Therefore, I rank it last."

REASONING = Based on the comment, the poster is NTA and the grandmother seems to be unreasonable in expecting the poster to cancel their vacation and potentially disrupt their life for an indefinite period of time. Therefore, statements that criticize the poster for not giving notice or being ungrateful are ranked lower. The highest ranked statements are those that recognize the grandmother's behavior as unreasonable and the poster's actions as reasonable, such as statement 3 which calls the poster out for taking advantage of the grandmother's generosity. Statement 9 is ranked high because it acknowledges that the poster's actions will create a problem for the grandmother, but also recognizes that the poster should not be solely responsible for fixing it. Statements 1 and 2 are ranked higher because they suggest that the poster should give notice, but do not place blame on the poster for not doing so. Statements 6, 4, and 10 are ranked lower because they suggest that the poster should give more notice or details than is necessary. Statement 8 is ranked lower because it suggests a specific time frame for notice that may not be feasible in this situation. Statement 7 is ranked the lowest because it implies that the poster is not obligated to be honest with the grandmother, which is not in line with the overall sentiment of the comment."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly believe that the person is acting like a freeloader and taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity, so statement 3 is ranked the highest. Statement 9 follows closely as the person is creating a problem for their grandmother by not giving her notice and should take responsibility for their actions. Statement 1 is ranked next as the person should give their grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements for her house. Statement 6 is ranked next as the person should let their grandmother know they're moving out as soon as possible. Statement 2 is ranked next as the person has been living with their grandmother virtually rent-free for 7 years and should show some courtesy and let her know they're moving out. Statement 5 is ranked next as the person is being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating their grandmother's kindness and generosity over the years. Statement 4 is ranked next as the person should treat their grandmother like any other landlord and give her the same notice they would give to a stranger. Statement 10 is ranked next as the person should be honest with their grandmother and let her know they're moving out, but they don't have to give her details about their new place. Statement 8 is ranked next as giving 30 days' notice before moving out is a standard courtesy. Statement 7 is ranked the lowest as the person is not obligated to tell their grandmother about their personal life, but they should let her know they're not going to rent her house."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the OP is not obligated to cancel their vacation plans for their best friend's wedding, but they should have communicated their plans to their grandmother earlier. Therefore, I agree with statements that suggest the OP should inform their grandmother about their moving out plans as soon as possible (3, 9, 1, 2, 4, 6). I also think that the OP has been living with their grandmother for free for a long time and should show some courtesy (5, 9). However, I disagree with statements that suggest the OP is ungrateful or taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity (5). I believe that the OP should give their grandmother a standard notice of 30 days (8), but they are not obligated to share details about their new place (10, 7)."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the person is not taking responsibility for their actions and is being inconsiderate towards their grandmother. Therefore, I agree with statements 3 and 9, which highlight the person's lack of responsibility and inconsideration. Statement 1 is also in line with my comment as it suggests giving notice to the grandmother, which the person should have done. Statement 6 is similar to 1, but I ranked it lower because it only mentions letting the grandmother know as soon as possible, without specifying a time frame.

Statements 4 and 2 are similar in that they both suggest giving notice, but I ranked 4 higher because it mentions treating the grandmother like any other landlord, which is a more responsible approach. Statement 2 is ranked lower because it implies that the person has no obligation to give notice, which contradicts my stance.

Statement 5 is ranked low because it implies that the person is entitled and ungrateful, which may not be entirely accurate. Statement 10 is ranked lower because it suggests being honest with the grandmother, but does not emphasize the importance of giving notice.

Statements 8 and 7 are ranked the lowest because they suggest that the person is not obligated to give details about their new place or that they don't have to give notice about their personal life. These statements contradict my stance and suggest that the person is not taking responsibility for their actions."

REASONING: Based on the comment, the poster is considered the asshole (YTA) for not canceling their vacation for their best friend's wedding and forgetting about the two months they were asked to keep open. This shows a lack of consideration and responsibility towards their friend and their commitments.

In the given slate, statement 3 directly aligns with the comment, stating that the poster is acting like a freeloader taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity and then screwing her over. This is the strongest statement, as it reflects the same sentiment as the comment.

Statement 9 follows, as it mentions creating a problem for the grandmother by not giving her notice and taking responsibility for actions, which is what the poster failed to do in the given situation.

Statement 1 comes next, as it emphasizes giving the grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements for her house. This is a reasonable request, and the poster should have considered it.

Statement 6 follows, as it highlights the need to inform the grandmother as soon as possible so she can make other plans for her house. This is closely related to statement 1.

Statement 2 is placed next, as it points out that the poster has been living with the grandmother virtually rent-free for 7 years and should show some courtesy by letting her know they're moving out. Although this statement is not as strong as the previous ones, it still holds some weight.

Statement 5 follows, as it accuses the poster of being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating the grandmother's kindness and generosity over the years. While this may be true, it is not as directly related to the situation as the previous statements.

Statement 4 is placed next, as it suggests treating the grandmother like any other landlord and giving her the same notice that would be given to a stranger. This is a reasonable expectation, but it is not as strong as the earlier statements.

Statement 10 is placed after statement 4, as it emphasizes being honest with the grandmother but not necessarily providing details about the new place. This is a reasonable request, but it is less important than the earlier statements.

Statement 8 follows, as it suggests giving the grandmother 30 days' notice as a standard courtesy. This is a reasonable expectation, but it is not as directly related to the situation as the earlier statements.

Statement 7 is placed last, as it only mentions informing the grandmother about not renting her house and not giving details about the new place. This statement is the least important, as it does not address the main issue of not giving notice or considering the grandmother's situation."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe the OP is TA (the asshole) for booking a vacation during their friend's wedding weekend without considering the commitment they made as a maid of honor. This shows a lack of consideration and prioritization of their own desires over their friend's important day.

The first statement in the ordering is ""You're acting like a freeloader who's taking advantage of your grandmother's generosity and then screwing her over."" This is because the OP's actions towards their friend and their wedding are similar to the behavior described in this statement. They are prioritizing their own desires over the needs and commitments they have made to others.

The second statement in the ordering is ""You're creating a problem for your grandmother by not giving her notice, and you should take responsibility for your actions."" This is because the OP's lack of notice to their grandmother about moving out is causing problems for her, and they should take responsibility for their actions.

The third statement in the ordering is ""You should give your grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements for her house."" This is because giving notice is a standard courtesy and responsibility that the OP should follow, regardless of their personal relationship with their grandmother.

The fourth statement in the ordering is ""You should let your grandmother know you're moving out as soon as possible so she can make other plans for her house."" This is because the OP's lack of notice is causing problems for their grandmother, and they should let her know as soon as possible so she can make other arrangements.

The fifth statement in the ordering is ""You've been living with her virtually rent-free for 7 years, so you should show some courtesy and let her know you're moving out."" This is because the OP has been living with their grandmother for a long time without paying rent, and they should show some basic courtesy and consideration by letting her know they are moving out.

The sixth statement in the ordering is ""You're being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating your grandmother's kindness and generosity over the years."" This is because the OP's lack of consideration for their grandmother's needs and feelings shows a lack of appreciation for her kindness and generosity.

The seventh statement in the ordering is ""You should treat your grandmother like any other landlord and give her the same notice you would give to a stranger."" This is because the OP's lack of notice is a standard courtesy and responsibility that they should follow, regardless of their personal relationship with their grandmother.

The eighth statement in the ordering is ""You should be honest with your grandmother and let her know you're moving out, but you don't have to give her details about your new place."" This is because the OP should be honest with their grandmother about their plans, but they do not have to share personal details about their new place if they do not want to.

The ninth statement in the ordering is ""You should give your grandmother 30 days' notice before moving out as a standard courtesy."" This is because giving 30 days' notice is a standard courtesy that the OP should follow, regardless of their personal relationship with their grandmother.

The tenth statement in the ordering is ""You're not obligated to tell your grandmother about your personal life, but you should let her know you're not going to rent her house."" This is because the OP is not obligated to share personal details about their life with their grandmother, but they should let her know that they are not going to rent her house."

Statement 5 implies that the AITA is ungrateful, which is not directly related to the situation but still relevant, so it is ranked in the middle. Statements 4 and 10 suggest that the AITA doesn't need to disclose personal details, which is a valid point but not the main issue, so they are ranked low.

The OP was aware of the possible wedding dates and should have kept them in mind. Therefore, I agree with statements 3 and 9, which criticize the OP for being inconsiderate and creating a problem for their grandmother.

Statements 6 and 7 are less relevant to the situation, but I still rank them higher than 8 because they emphasize the importance of communication and taking responsibility for one's actions. Statement 10 is the least relevant because it suggests that the OP doesn't need to share details about their new place, but I still rank it higher than 8 because it acknowledges the need for honesty. Statement 8 is the least preferred because it suggests a minimum notice period, but it doesn't address the OP's lack of consideration for their grandmother's plans."

I do not agree with statement 8, which suggests giving the grandmother 30 days' notice, because it is not necessary and may not be feasible for the OP. I also do not agree with statement 2, which suggests that the OP should show courtesy by letting their grandmother know about their plans, because the OP has already asked their friend about their wedding plans before booking the vacation."

REASONING: Based on the comment, it seems like the person asking the question has already made up their mind about not cancelling their vacation and is looking for alternatives. The most disliked statement is therefore the one that implies they are taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity (3). The next most disliked statements are those that imply the person is being ungrateful or entitled (5, 9). After that, the statements that suggest the person should give their grandmother notice or be honest with her are ranked higher (1, 2, 6, 4, 8, 10). Finally, the statement that suggests the person is not obligated to share personal details with their grandmother is ranked the lowest (7), as it goes against the general theme of being respectful and considerate towards the grandmother."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the poster is the asshole here. However, I do agree that the poster should communicate their plans to their grandmother out of courtesy. I strongly disagree with statement 3, which accuses the poster of taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity. I also agree with statements 5 and 9, which emphasize the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions and being honest with the grandmother. I agree with statement 1 and 2, which suggest giving the grandmother notice, but I think they are less important than being honest and taking responsibility. I disagree with statement 6, which suggests letting the grandmother know as soon as possible, because I think it's more important to be honest and take responsibility than to rush the communication. I also disagree with statement 4, which compares the grandmother to a stranger, because the grandmother is not a stranger. I think statement 10 is the least important, because it suggests withholding details about the new place, which I don't think is necessary. I also think statement 7 is less important, because it suggests that the poster is not obligated to share personal details, but I think they should communicate their plans. I think statement 8 is the least important, because it suggests a specific time frame for giving notice, but I think the most important thing is to communicate honestly and take responsibility."

I also think that the OP should have communicated their plans to their grandmother earlier and shown some basic courtesy, as they have been living with her rent-free for 7 years.

I also agree with statements 1, 6, and 2, which suggest that the OP should have given their grandmother notice and shown some basic courtesy. Statement 5, which calls the OP entitled and ungrateful, is also in line with my opinion. I agree with statements 4 and 10 to a lesser extent, as they suggest that the OP should treat their grandmother like any other landlord, but I think the OP's behavior goes beyond that and is disrespectful. I agree with statement 8 to a lesser extent as well, as it suggests that the OP should give their grandmother 30 days' notice, but I think they should have communicated their plans earlier.

Statement 5 also implies that the OP is ungrateful, but I already expressed that sentiment in statement 3.

Statement 8 is ranked low because it suggests a specific time frame for giving notice, which may not be feasible or necessary in this situation. Statement 10 is ranked low because it suggests that the OP should be dishonest with their grandmother, which is not a good solution.

Finally, statement 7 is ranked last because it implies that the OP is not obligated to tell their grandmother anything about their personal life, which is a narrow and ungenerous interpretation of the situation."

Statement 5, which says that the person is being ungrateful and entitled, is partially true because they have been living rent-free for 7 years.

The slate statements reflect a range of opinions, from those who believe the poster should prioritize their grandmother's needs (1, 6, 4, 2, 5) to those who believe the poster should prioritize their own needs (3, 9, 10). I agree with the statements that suggest the poster is being inconsiderate and taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity (3, 9), and that they should take responsibility for their actions (9). I also agree that the poster should give their grandmother notice (1, 6, 4), but I don't think they are obligated to give details about their new place (10) or prioritize their grandmother's needs over their own (7). I disagree with the statements that suggest the poster is being ungrateful or entitled (5), as they have been living with their grandmother for 7 years and paying little to no rent. I also disagree with the statement that suggests the poster should treat their grandmother like any other landlord (4), as they have a personal relationship with her. I rank the statements in this order because I believe the poster has a responsibility to consider their grandmother's needs, but ultimately should prioritize their own needs and be honest with their grandmother about their plans."

REASONING = Based on the comment, it is important to consider the timeline of when the vacation was booked and the wedding date was given. If the vacation was booked without knowing the wedding date, then the commenter believes that the person in question (let's call them P) is not the asshole here. However, if P had a long period of time where they knew the wedding date but did not cancel the vacation, then they are acting irresponsibly and not showing basic courtesy to their grandmother. The commenter agrees with statements 3 and 9, which highlight P's lack of consideration for their grandmother. They also agree with statements 1, 6, and 2, which suggest that P should have communicated their plans to their grandmother as soon as possible. Statement 5 is also agreed upon, as P is being ungrateful for not appreciating their grandmother's kindness over the years. Statement 4 is partially agreed upon, as P should treat their grandmother like any other landlord, but the commenter believes that a 30-day notice is not enough in this situation. Statement 10 is partially agreed upon, as P should be honest with their grandmother but does not need to give details about their new place. Statements 7 and 8 are the least agreed upon, as the commenter believes that P has a responsibility to communicate their plans to their grandmother and take responsibility for their actions."

Statement 3 is the most agreed upon because the poster is taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity. Statement 9 follows because the poster is creating a problem for their grandmother by not giving notice. Statement 1 is next because the poster should give their grandmother notice so she can make other arrangements. Statement 6 is next because the poster should let their grandmother know as soon as possible. Statement 4 follows because the poster should treat their grandmother the same as any other landlord. Statement 2 is next because the poster has been living there rent-free for 7 years. Statement 5 is next because the poster is being ungrateful for not appreciating their grandmother's kindness.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the poster is not the asshole in this situation. However, I do think that they have a responsibility to inform their grandmother about their plans in a timely and considerate manner. Statement 3 is the most in line with my perspective, as it implies that the poster has been taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity and should be more mindful of the impact of their actions. Statement 9 aligns with this perspective as well, emphasizing the importance of taking responsibility for creating a problem for the grandmother.

Statements 1, 6, and 4 all suggest that the poster should give their grandmother notice before moving out, which I agree with. However, I rank them lower than statements 3 and 9 because they don't explicitly acknowledge the poster's responsibility to be considerate of their grandmother's needs.

Statement 2 is less agreeable to me because it implies that the poster should inform their grandmother out of a sense of obligation, rather than as a matter of basic courtesy. Statement 5 is also less agreeable because it frames the poster's actions as ungrateful and entitled, which I don't think is entirely fair.

Statements 10, 8, and 7 are the least agreeable to me because they suggest that the poster doesn't need to be fully transparent with their grandmother about their plans. While I agree that the poster doesn't need to share personal details, I do think they have a responsibility to be honest about their intentions. Overall, my ranking reflects my belief that the poster should prioritize their grandmother's needs and be transparent about their plans, while also recognizing that they have the right to make their own decisions."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the poster is the asshole here. They have a life and are not obligated to cancel their vacation for their friend's wedding. However, I do agree that the poster should communicate their decision to their grandmother in a respectful manner. Statement 7 aligns with my perspective, as it acknowledges that the poster doesn't have to share personal details but should inform their grandmother about their plans. Statement 10 also resonates with my view, as it emphasizes the need for honesty without requiring excessive sharing of information.

Statements 8, 6, and 4 suggest giving the grandmother notice, which I agree with, but they are ranked lower because they imply a level of obligation that I don't fully support. Statement 9 is ranked lower because it places blame on the poster for creating a problem, which I don't think is entirely fair.

Statements 2, 5, and 3 are ranked the lowest because they imply that the poster is ungrateful, a freeloader, or entitled, which contradicts my belief that the poster is not the asshole in this situation. Statement 1 is ranked last because it suggests that the grandmother might need to find another tenant, which I think is an overreaction given the context."

It's wholly unreasonable to not secure a date and to expect people to effectively block out 5 months in anticipation of them getting their shit together.

Last friday my Wife and I took our 2 kids under 3 to the playground in our neighborhood park.  This was a rare Friday where there were no commitments as we usually take them first thing in the morning.    

As we approached we noticed there were probably a dozen kids there and 2 large labs running in the grassy area unleashed.  My wife and I are like the dogs shouldn't be there unleashed but our little guy was excited to be at the playground.  So we continued.  We let our boy run around and the younger one we put in the swing.  Some parents that were there started talking to us.  They are essentially one big neighborhood parent group and meet up weekly.  I didn't know anyone in this group.  

My son climbed a structure and went down a slide.  Once he was off the slide there were no kids on that structure.  A lady that had the 2 dogs there (I still don't know if she was a parent), let the dogs onto the playground structure and let them go down the slide.

As a parent with young children under three, I would have seen the dogs and went to a different park. I love dogs (most of the time). But I always err on the side of caution when it comes to dogs I don’t know. I am also disabled and have spent a lot of time with service dogs. Most, if not ALL, service dog handlers take their dogs to dog parks to help them get out energy and play. Not parks where children play.

It just seems like such a dumb risk. What if a child was allergic to dogs? What if a child decided to “play” with the dogs and the dogs got hurt? What if the dogs knocked a child off the play equipment? There’s just so many unknowns when it comes to strange dogs and strange children.

Being 'service dogs' is irrelevant in terms of the behaviour you describe.

Also:

>make sure my kids are comfortable around dogs before bringing them around dogs

Nope - dogs kill people by mauling them... even if the dogs have always been well-behaved and the victim is someone 'comfortable around dogs' e.g. recently in the UK a professional dog-walker was mauled to death by the dogs they were walking and a child was mauled to death by the family dog she 'had a loving relationship with'...",79,0,,,NTA,,NTA Being 'service dogs' is irrelevant in terms of the behaviour you describe.

The ADA clearly states that service animals must be “harnessed, leashed, or tethered” unless it would somehow prevent them from fulfilling their service.

But if the dogs were, per their owner, “off duty”, then *there’s no possible service a leash could prevent them from performing.*

Go to a dog park.  I even understand running in a field, if otherwise empty.  But they shouldn't be on a busy playground.  Service dogs shouldn't even be accessible to others, especially children who have no self-control.

I don’t know what condition requires 2 service dogs, but apparently she has that.

That doesn’t mean you can let 2 large dogs run around unleashed in a playground with 3 year old children. And when someone complains, turn it around, and demand that children must get comfortable with your dogs.

You didn’t need to tell her she’s insane. (Even though valuing her dogs fun over random children may sound insane to you.)

At the party we typically have a huge costume contest. You pay 5 dollars to enter and if you win, you win the pot. We usually pull about 30 to 50 entries. So the prize is pretty nice. This year we had 40 people enter and about 160 people attending. 

In years past, the winner has been this one specific chick That my brothers wanna fuck. Her costume is usually the typical sorority girl costume (an animal of some kind, boots, fishnet leggings, a short skirt, basically a bra or corset, and then animal ears and light face paint). 

Now I’m not a Halloween nazi. This year my costume was literally just a angel wings, and white shorts, and a halo. I know fully that I’m dressing up so hot guys that think I’m hot will take notice and that it’s not a “good costume”. Her costume isn’t good. Sure, she looks good in it. But the point of the party is who has the best breasts

So we have the contest, and she’s wearing her MO. She was a bee, but her ass was hanging out and her boobs were about to fall out of her shirt. So we held the contest, people voted anonymously, and guess what. She won. But by one vote. I hadn’t voted yet, so I simply casted my vote then my vice chairman, who agreed with me casted his vote. That just happened to be enough to put her at second place. 

When I told my by brothers they bitched and moaned about it, but I told them she simply didn’t win and she should do better next year. They eventually talked me into creating a runner up prize of 50 dollars to the girl.

When we announced the winner, she was visibly upset. This was the first time she hasn’t won in the last 4 years. Now apparently, last night one of my brothers was simping hard and told her that I intentionally voted against her because I didn’t like her (not true, I’m genuinely apathetic about her).

She found me later that night and cursed me out and said I had a problem with her. I told her simply that we weren’t having a sluttiest costume contest, but a best costume contest and that she’s lucky we bent the rules to give her 50 bucks. We argued and ended up getting separated.

Now a lot of my brothers are pissed at me for pissing her off.

You're all taking a competition far too seriously.

If ""sexy"" is a way to win then that is the nature of the contest. These are frat guys. Of course they're going to vote for whoever's hottest.

You shouldn't have got to vote after votes were counted. The vice chair really shouldn't have voted I don't see why there couldn't have been a tie with the prize money split.

Since there wasn't a rule about joint first place, then there's no reason to split the money.

We became close after she experienced a traumatic event and I wanted to support her due to my own experience with abuse. We fell in love quickly despite our pasts. Although we both have trust issues, we're learning to communicate and work through our disagreements. However, she often threatens to end the relationship when she gets upset, causing stress for me.

Halloween night, we were having fun at my house.  I was trying to clean up before bed, but I was in a lot of pain due to a back injury. I commented ""I feel like a maid."" She instantly got upset. I calmed her down and apologized, telling her I'm  in pain so everything feels harder than normal.

She asked for a ride to get clothes for work the next day, but I'd been drinking and didn't feel safe driving. She said she felt fine, asking to drive my car instead. I agreed, telling her to text me when she was on her way back. She took all her things with her, which seemed odd since she coming back.

After falling asleep briefly, I woke up to find her gone and a text saying she wouldn't be returning my car, but would pick me up for work in the morning. I tried calling her but it went straight to voicemail and she wasn't answering my texts. With a spare car and house key, I decided to take an Uber to her apartment so we could talk. I quickly learned she suspended my access code to get into the apartment complex. I was locked out and unable to contact her. Feeling furious, I ended up driving my car back home, unable to resolve the situation.

She called me in the morning, upset because I was mad at her for taking my car. I explained she can't keep it without permission. I said ""you knew you weren't coming back when you took all her things last night."" Her response was ""so!"" I stated she should've taken an Uber instead. She angrily agreed to return my car and hung up on me. I decided to let her panic by not revealing that I already had the car.  

She called 38 times and texted repeatedly, asking if I had the car, but I ignored her. After 45 min, I called her revealing I had taken it last night to teach her a lesson. She was furious! Saying ""never contact me again, please get help!""

At this point she still had my car keys with my house/mail/parents' keys attached to them. Asking her to bring them back, she ignored me by putting her phone on do not disturb. I warned her I'd call the police if she didn't return them. After waiting and getting no response, I called the police to help. They couldn't come for hours due to being busy. Worried that she may have thrown my keys away, I changed the lock on my front door. Later that day, she returned my keys, including the spare key I gave her, leaving them on my doorstep. I only saw her back as she was leaving, but she seemed sad.

This year, we finally saved enough to plan an amazing trip to my home country, where she could meet my family and see where I grew up. We spent six months planning it and were excited.

The trip was a tour of several cities, visiting family and exploring. Things went well until the last city, where I planned to meet my dad (who raised me after my parents divorced) and some aunts. My wife mentioned she had a friend in town she might see, and I was fine with that. But when we arrived, she got sick and felt terrible, so she wanted to stay in bed and insisted I go see my family without her. I stayed with her for a bit, got her food, and told her to reach out if she needed anything. I visited some friends and later returned to the Airbnb that night.

The next day, she was still unwell, and again urged me to go meet family. I had lunch with my aunt, who was asking me about my wife and even suggested medicine for her when I told her she was sick. After lunch I told my aunt I was going back to the Airbnb to check on my wife, and on my way there I texted her asking how she was feeling to which she replied she was still very sick and with a massive headache.

I was with my dad until 11 p.m. and then I went back to the Airbnb. She was not there yet when I arrived and ended up coming back at around 1 a.m.

On our last day, my family invited us to breakfast. I got ready early, and my wife suddenly felt better and wanted to join. I told her it felt too late—she had chosen not to meet them before, so I went alone.

You could have communicated in the moment that you were disappointed she chose to see her friend rather than rest for your final day so she could meet your family. 

It was petty of you to have spent 4 years planning a trip for her to meet your parents to deny her that chance. 

I also don't understand how you managed to spend the whole day apart from her and only question if you were wrong when she made accusations. Surely you knew it wasn't okay to exclude her like that. 

Her behaviour wasn't considerate of you or your family and it seems strange she was well enough to be out until early in the morning after having been ill. 

She should have returned early to prioritise meeting your family on your last day.

I know this game and play it a lot with my friends. The goal really is to come up with a controversial prompt, and it's actually really common (when we play at least) to do this by ""targeting"" a person (or 2-3 when playing in a larger group) with something personal. We switch up who we ""target"" and tend to go for the people we're closest to first/more, so that it doesn't become bullying.

Telling me that I'd ""targeted you"" wouldn't necessarily register as you being upset with me, because that's the language we use (that or ""attacked"") along with jokes about going home, not playing anymore, a partner sleeping on the sofa etc.

However, that doesn't mean that you can't have boundaries. It's absolutely valid to have things that are too personal to be joked about, and once you've communicated that it shouldn't be used in future. The person should also apologise.

When someone makes a joke about my mom even though they know she has passed and I’m adopted I don’t get upset about it because I know how these guys are and what being in the chat entails. I would never play a game like this with you ever again after this. I’m not saying what he did was right but I am saying that you should stick to games that won’t trigger you because you seem to be a bit soft and this is a touchy subject. And just FYI if I knew this info I might actually have said something about your birth mom also if I knew it would help me win. Not to be a dick or not to even trigger you but if this game is what I think then ya you’re the asshole and shouldn’t be upset.,-1,0,,,YTA,,YTA- why would you be upset when you know the game is to be kind of “edgey”.

Post,1gi5k6b,AITA for refusing to eat the food my FIL made and lying about why?,Unknown,2024-11-02 20:25:45,"So I (26F) have been married to my husband Nikolas (29M) for over a year. He was raised in the UK, his father his Greek and his mother is English. When his parents got divorced, his father moved back to Greece, and because Niko has always had a strained relationship with his father, they don't talk or see each other very much - but they tend to get together to have dinner whenever he's back in the UK. 

This time he was back for a month and he rented out an apartment and so he invited around the both of us around - he didn't specify that we were going to eat anything, just said we could have a few drinks and chat. I've only met him once or twice before now, and I didn't see any reason not to do so and figured that it would be some good backup for Niko if he wanted to leave early or anything. So we went around yesterday at around 9pm. 

When we got there, FIL had made a traditional Greek dish called spanakopita (sort of like a pie but it's made with filo pastry, it has spinach and feta). For context, I have a history of anorexia, and eating in front of people that I don't really know is still an issue for me, and anything with pastry is something that I tend to avoid even now. He was pleasant enough, welcomed us all in and offered us the food, and I said no thank you because I was anxious with the situation. 

Niko caught on that I was uncomfortable and so told his dad that we'd already eaten, but his dad kept insisting that we should try it. At us saying no again, he got very up in arms about how he'd gone to the effort of making the food, and that it shouldn't be such an issue for us to just have some of it, and that he felt as though we were disrespecting him by refusing to eat the food. 

So husband and I apologised, offered to stay for drinks, but ultimately left as he remained angry about the situation. I know I could have explained why I didn't want to eat it, but I felt uncomfortable trauma dumping on him about the real reason why, or I could have tried a little bit and then just left it and he probably would have been fine.

He probably considered eating before coming to see him to be rude, obviously depending on context it can be rude.

On the other hand, if they aren’t eating because they aren’t feeling well, that’s totally okay. It happens, and I wouldn’t fault them at all!
