It’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever faced, and honestly, I’ve just been trying to survive each day since. Right after he died, his mom (my MIL) stepped in and insisted on paying for all the funeral expenses. I was completely out of it, just in a fog, and really grateful for the help. Here’s the thing: I totally forgot that my husband had a small life insurance policy through my job. I only remembered it recently and filed a claim, getting a payout. It’s not a huge amount of money, but enough to help me move back across the country to be with my family and maybe put something down on a modest home so I can start over. When my MIL found out about the insurance payout, she flipped out. She’s demanding I pay her back for the funeral costs and accusing me of ‘using’ her son. She’s said some really hurtful things, calling me selfish and implying I’m somehow profiting off his death. But she offered to pay for the funeral, and I truly didn’t know about the insurance money at the time. I’m still so broken over losing him, and the thought of being called heartless just adds to the pain. I know she’s grieving too, but I’m trying to do what’s best for me to heal and move forward. So, AITA if I don’t give her the money? I’m already barely holding it together and just need a chance to rebuild my life. I’m ready, I hope- to handle the criticism that may be coming my way.',\n",

My son \"Sam\" had his ninth birthday today, but we\\'re having the actual \"party\" tomorrow night, which is basically just a sleepover at our apartment with two friends. One is in his class and the other in a different one(same school though). Before my son even got home from the bus I got a call from his teacher \"Lorna\" requesting that the party involve all the students in the class. She learned about it because it came up as the class wished him a happy birthday. I at first politely refused, saying that\\'s not reasonable but she insisted to make sure nobody was left out. I respond by saying that she has no say in who is at my home ever and that even if she did, my apartment simply cannot accommodate 32 kids and guardians. She says that because other students are involved, she does and that I should have the party somewhere that can allow all students. I was ready to either hang up or tell her off, but what she said at the end sparked an idea. I tell her \"Okay, what\\'s your address?\" and when she asks why, I told that since you think you have a say and you want all your students to be a part, we might as well have the party have her house, and request her address again. There\\'s a pause before she says that\\'s not exactly what she meant and I tell her that no, she wants everyone to attend so she should be the one to make it work, before hanging up. This is where I probably became the asshole. Out of curiosity I easily found her address(her SM is not private at all) and email her \"how does this email sound?\" with an excerpt to the group email chain saying that Lorna has offered to host Sam\\'s birthday party at her home and to come after school to X address. I was NOT planning on actually sending that to anyone else but her, I just wanted to prove the point and felt I was being sarcastic but I know tone is hard online. She responded to not send it and to do whatever I want for the birthday, she does not care anymore. When I vented to my husband about it he called me unhinged but he agreed with my point.

I didn’t open the mailbox. It’s not my fault the brand is on the box. I send it to my wife and said “thanks for the shoes.” I didn’t think it would blow up. Maybe this is where I fucked up. I don’t open the package but clearly it’s some sort of shoe. I didn’t expect her to get mad but she got furious. She said “I told you not to look.” “Why do you have to put your nose in everything.” Maybe 30-40 more texts come. She starts calling me names and compared me to her cousins boyfriend, who apparently would never do this. Now she’s not talking to me. I didn’t even want a gift. I told her no gifts.

I’m going to make an assumption here that the relationship probably isn’t all that bad. Now since the present came with an indicator of what it is… it’s kind of hard for OP to not know what it is. All he knows is it’s a shoe. It would be unreasonable for it to be his fault for knowing that it’s a shoe. He had no malicious intent or even a want to spoil the surprise. That’s a product of circumstance. Now sending the image to the wife was purely unlucky and is just another life lesson to be experienced. OP could probably have done it better by just sending a text but sending the image would have made the wife assume that it was opened and mare her feel like her efforts wasted. Now that sucks 100% but you can’t call the guy an asshole just for that. He never even opened the package. OP I think just calmly explain that you were a bit unlucky and never meant to ruin your surprise. The logo was there and there was nothing you could do about it. It’s like if someone told you to listen to a new song but you already heard it while standing at the shops and you didn’t even know that was the new song. The wife overreacted but don’t tell her that. Be calm ,acknowledge her feelings which is a hard thing to do as a guy but it’s gotta be done, and explain you never intended to hurt her it was just out of ur control. Explain that if it was up to you then you wished you had never seen it at all and thank her again for the gift (don’t mention you never wanted a gift that won’t help hahaha) NTA'},\n",

I’m currently working 2 jobs, 5 days a week. I’m also a full-time student, so my other 2 days are taken up with being at school for 10-12 hours. I’m in my senior year of my degree as well so it’s a heavy course load and I’m also applying to grad school and internships at the moment. All 7 days of my week are occupied with either work or school, and I have to wake up between 5-7 am everyday. I’m barely home, but when I am home it’s spent doing homework, eating, and sleeping. My boyfriend finished his degree a couple years ago and he is working full time, 4 days a week. Outside of that, he goes to the gym about 5 days a week, every Friday night he goes bowling with his friends, and a couple days a week he plays a card game with his friends. At the start of the semester, we agreed that he would take on most of the chores, but I would help when I can and I’d still help with dinner because I enjoy cooking. He sometimes complains about having to do the chores and will ask me to help out with things here and there such as cleaning the cat’s litter, and I’ll do it. We both hate cleaning honestly so I get it’s annoying, but I’m starting to feel frustrated when he expects me to help with more chores. In my eyes, we agreed on this beforehand and he was completely okay with supporting me. He also has 3 days a week that he gets to sleep in and he’s able to go the gym and have hobbies. I’ve been stressed because I don’t even have the time or mental capacity to make doctors appts that I need, and I had to stop going to the gym a couple months back. I don’t have the luxury of having time for myself, not to mention my body is physically sore as both my jobs also require me being on my feet all day. AITA for getting frustrated that he expects me to help with housework too or am I putting too much on his plate? Does this sound balanced/fair? Update: Thank you for both perspectives I needed it! To answer some questions: -We split the bills evenly, I also have car payments hence why I needed a second job to help cover it. One of my jobs is also relevant to my field and I need it for my resume. -My schedule is my choice to an extent, I’m going into a career in healthcare and the current school load is required, I don’t have any flexibility there. -I work 40-45 hrs a week, he works 40. -As someone said, we both see it as him supporting me towards my goals, and ultimately we want a life together, it was an agreement for our future. -We do errands together, I still help with dishes and laundry regularly.

I always thought I was the only one who saw this in her and never directly told anyone about it. There have been past situations that make me feel this way, but I digress.

After the ceremony I went to go see Sophia and some other friends. I was shocked when I saw her wearing a white dress. Yes, it did have some flowers on it, but still! It was enough white to be too much. I was pissed. I quickly pulled her to the side and told her to get the hell out. A couple days before the wedding she also was talking about how me and my now husband shouldn\\'t be together. (she said this to one of our other friends, who told me). I knew it was a bad idea having her here but I didn\\'t think she would wear white. She eventually left and my husband was telling me that I overreacted. Now I\\'m contemplating everything.

She\\'s the \"permanently busy\" type - if you know, you know. Always doing something, can\\'t be alone with her thoughts for one second, hyper-extroverted, etc. She\\'s a nice person but that pattern of compulsive \"busy-ness\" got on my nerves from the start. Like...after we graduated she worked part-time. That\\'s it. For extra money she let out the other three bedrooms in her house. No kids, no dogs, no serious partners, no ailing relatives. And despite working maximum 2-3 days a week from 8 to 3, she was almost impossible to get a hold of. I lived 30 minutes away ON FOOT and we\\'d still see each other every 3-4 months at best. And every time, the spiel was \"I know it\\'s been ages but I\\'m just so BUSY!\". A few years ago I moved so we\\'re now in different countries. I tried to stay in touch via WhatsApp but even that\\'s been falling apart. Over the lockdown she got married and had two kids. So you can imagine how hard she is to get a hold of now that she actually has responsibilities and isn\\'t just busy being busy. So for the past year now our interactions have dwindled down to me sending her life updates and asking about hers...and her getting back weeks later if I\\'m lucky, months later or not at all if I\\'m not, with a generic \"so sorry, been so busy but you\\'re in my thoughts, how are you x\". Meanwhile she\\'s still pretty active on social media and regularly posting about all the fun things she gets up to with all those other people. So to cut a long story short, I decided this means she\\'s just not interested and trying to tell me nicely. I mean...how else am I supposed to take barely answering me, and if so mostly just to remind me for the millionth time of just how BUSY she is, while simultaneously showing off all the things and people she \\\\does\\\\ miraculously find the time for? Now here\\'s the kicker. She messaged me about three months after my last message, once again with a generic \"so sorry, so busy, how are u xx\". And I chose not to respond because I\\'m over it. A month later (last week) it was my birthday, and she sent a birthday message and sounded quite upset I hadn\\'t responded to the previous one. I responded by telling her what I said in the title: \"What\\'s the point of messaging you anyway, when I already know how it\\'s gonna go? I\\'ll pass. Let me know if you ever get less permanently busy and can keep in touch on a more substantial level than getting back to me months later just to remind me of how busy you are\". I heard through the grapevine (mutual friends/acquaintances) that she\\'s upset at how I talked to her. But I don\\'t think I\\'m in the wrong here. Am I obligated to keep making an effort for someone who just can\\'t or won\\'t reciprocate? And FFS - isn\\'t it bizarre to get upset when someone you clearly don\\'t care enough about to make an effort to include in your life, lets go? ETA: \"update\" in the comments.',\n",

But I like it.“ So the misunderstanding came about like this: She bought herself chocolate shavings without added white sugar and told me about it. When she went shopping some weeks later she saw her favorite ones (dark chocolate) and decided that it was not worth the extra effort for her to get the other ones. She also told me, they don’t have the same crunch, so she decided to go with the „regular“ ones. So thanks to those, that gave me the „extra nudge“. She smiled and told me I should‘ve told her directly. Have a great rest of the week. ————————————————————— Hello, my partner (f in her 30s) is quite into sport and not much into sweets. She stopped eating ADDED sugar „completely“ about a year ago. She doesn’t have a medical constitution, but just realized, that she‘s doing way better without the sugar. She also doesn’t restrict my eating. For example, when we went to a fancy cake place I wanted to go to, she also ate cake, but was feeling a little nauseous afterwards. So she‘s not completely strict-strict, as sometimes she enjoys honey or if I bake something, e.g.. Now to my dilemma: every weekend she makes coffee for us and does a „special blend“. When she made it before she used cocoa powder, but changed to dark chocolate shavings. It‘s really really nice, but I realized some days ago that she doesn’t know that there is sugar in them. She eats her yogurt topped with them and is beaming with joy, when telling me „they don’t contain sugar“. They do, she just had the wrong column when checking them. I really love seeing her happy and I researched before and the chocolate shavings without sugar are 1. expensive and 2. I‘m actually not able to eat them (due to intolerance). I also really support her otherwise, when cooking, baking, etc. I check twice as not to include any sugar. (I also realize on the other hand that she‘s mostly checking for Glucose and doesn’t care about fructose.) So WIBTA if I don‘t tell her that there‘s sugar in her new found joy? EDIT: to fix typos 2. EDIT: Thanks guys. I think I just needed a nudge to make the right decision. I‘m at her place tomorrow and will talk to her. 3. EDIT: To clarify: I put “added” in, as people were confused. Sorry, I thought it was obvious, that one’s on my part. The yoghurt used in the example she‘s eating has no added sugar. Yes she knows that there are different types of sugar. As I mentioned before, it‘s about added Glucose. Yes she is capable of reading. No, she‘s not stupid, as the package has two different collums as it‘s baking chocolate and one type of them has no added sugar but sweetener. Yes, I know, that there are also Health risk when consuming too much sweetener. It was a simple question guys.',\n",

But overall I seem like a “normal” person, and I think that's what he gets stuck on. Every time I try to talk about problems to my mom, well he's around. It turns into a dick measuring competition of which one of us is more disabled. Personally I think that's a regressive mindset and puts more stigma on mental health by saying there's a magical bar you have to get to for your struggles to really matter. But clearly he thinks two different disabilities should be measured on a one to one scale and his disability is worse than mine. He states that he's disabled to but doesn't have nearly as much trouble as I do and his disability is worse than mine. His disability being ptsd from time as a marin. He believes because he's really disabled (the government sends him money every month) And I'm not( because it's incredibly difficult to get disability for migraines) that he gets to tell me how to handle my disability and that i'm doing it poorly. Not only that he very much implies that I'm not just playing up my issues but faking them. This all came to a head when I told him well he was on another of his tirades, That he got a say in his disability. Not only Is he a man and his issues are actually taken seriously by the medical industry, but he applied for the military knowing about ptsd. He got 18 years of normality before going into the military, and he knew he had a risk of developing ptsd when he went in. I however was born this way and had no control over my trauma as I was a child when it occurred. Please don't get me wrong. I fully respect veterans and their need for treatment. They deserve respect and validation. I was just tired of him telling me I wasn't disabled and had no excuse for not being a fully functional member of society because even if I was disabled he can function just fine. I have never before played down his ptsd (and I don't think pointing out he had an idea that going into the military could and likely would result in ptsd is me down playing it.) I normally don't even justify his comments about me with a real response. I just wanted to point out that it's not fair to compare our struggles on a one to one scale, and that i am just as deserving of understanding for my disabilities as he is. After 2 years of him degrading and belittling my issues. Now he's trying to get my mom to kick me out because of how disrespectful I was to him. Even though this is the first time I have ever snapped back at him, well he's always going on and on and on about how I'm a failure of a human being. edit: im am working not just sitting around moping in my isuese. his problem is its only a part time job.\",\n",

As a reward for doing so well I have told them I\\'d pay their way for a vacation during their spring break in a few months, anywhere that they\\'d like to go (well, within reason. If either picked Antarctica we\\'d have to talk about that).

However a combination of overhearing some details and seeing some info has me a bit unsettled. They have plans to go to a resort called -- get this -- Hedonism.

Even though he was not a pescetarian when he and I started dating (at 20) he is now fully pescetarian (and even stronger in his conviction than me!). It\\'s been 5 or so years that he is fully pescetarian. His family (extended and immediate) knows this, and we\\'ve spent many family meals/holidays together.

He\\'s explained to them \"I don\\'t eat meat anymore\" multiple times, but it keeps re-occuring. His parents are very young so I doubt this is a memory issue. It feels like they are trying to undermine his choice, and they seem to hold this against me, despite the fact that I never forced/force him to do this! His mother will often makes comment \"oh so you really don\\'t eat any meat anymore?\" His parents have no issues accomodating their nieces / nephews who are severely picky eaters, but they routinely don\\'t prepare anything pescetarian (so we end up eating what we\\'ve brought if we\\'ve brought a side or dish) and then his parents will say \"Oh we\\'re sorry, we didn\\'t realize you wouldn\\'t eat any of the food!\" Maybe I\\'m in my head a bit about it but it feels intentional.

       " '1gpmt6i': {'description': 'So I live in Finland at a student apartment complex. I had done some laundry the day before, and was going to pick them up from the drying room. There was this older woman doing her laundry. What caught my eye was that she had a green water hose going from the laundry room\\'s seperate water tap into the laundry machine\\'s hatch/hole where you put the detergents. I had not seen that kind of water hose setup before, so I was curious. I asked about it, and if the water pipes that normally supply the water to the machine had gone dry. She said in pretty good Finnish that she didn\\'t understand the question. I presume she didn\\'t know the word for water hose (vesiletku), so I repeated the question, this time pointing to the hose and pipes. She asked if I spoke any Russian. I didn\\'t, but I had access to Google Translate. As I was writing, she told me to \"stop bullying her\", which I first took as humorous banter between neighbours. I showed her the translation, but she refused to look at it, again repeating that I should stop bullying her, and that I should back off. Confused, I asked what she meant, but she took her own phone, began filming me, and said that if I would not stop \"bullying\" her she would send the video to the police (!?). As she refused to even listen to my explanations, I stopped trying. I still had my dry laundry in the adjacent drying room, so what followed was kind of awkward 5 minutes as I folded my clothes up and she kept sitting on the laundry room bench. The threat to call the cops on me seemed very uncalled for, so I wanted to try one more time to set the record straigth. So I wrote a little \"sorry about that, I was just curious about the hose\" paragraph to explain and de-escalate the situation. She again refused to look at my phone, and said very rudely that she didn\\'t want to talk to me nor see me. All our communication was in Finnish, as she refused to look at my attempted Russian translations. Idk if I did anything wrong, but here are my theories to what might have gone wrong on my part: She said that she had reserved the laundry room, and took my presence as barging in. (However, the reservations are for the laundry machines, and I was picking up my dried up laundry. I had every right to be there) She took my (20-ish male) casual talking to her (35-45 yr woman) as some sort of sexual harrasment? She took my male presence as threatening? When I brought my phone closer to her face that she could read the translations, that\\'s when she told me to back off. However, I was keeping the polite-distance-with-strangers the whole time. Russo-Finnish mistranslation? Although she spoke Finnish very well, she clearly didn\\'t know some words. * Cultural difference in something? I had acted calm and casual (though increasingly confused) during the whole situation, but thought it was both very unwarranted and rude as fuck by the woman to begin filming me and threatening to call the cops on me.

I don't like people imposing music on me, so in a VERY bold move, I turned off the speaker's power button.

It's not perfect, but no roommate situation will be, and I'm fairly happy overall. The remaining roommate (we'll call them Alex) is a bit of a different story. Throughout the few months that we've been living together, there have been a lot of issues related to Alex. Most is a minor annoyance, some is a more serious, but there is always something going on. And it always seems to be because of Alex. I'll also note that Alex is of a different culture than the rest of us, and also is from a different place than where we now live. We've tried to be understanding, but as with everything, sometimes there will be practices we disagree on. About a week and a half ago, Alex started insisting on closing the bathroom door, even when no one is in the bathroom. Apparently this is a cultural aspect for them, where it's considered impolite to keep the bathroom door open. I do want to note that this wasn't an issue until months into living together? That doesn't make it less legitimate, but it stood out as odd to all of us that this wasn't brought up sooner. All three of us have disagreed with closing the door. It's not about any particular cultural stance. We have issues with that door and handle sticking, so if it's closed, it's hard to tell if someone's in there or not. We don't want to keep it closed without others being in there to avoid this confusion. We have offered to leave it mostly closed, so it's still mostly hidden but you can see there's no one in there. This came to a head earlier today. Alex had closed the door after leaving the bathroom. Some time later, I really needed to take a dump. I see that the door is closed so knock to see if anyone is in there. There's no response and so I try to open the door, but because the door and handle really like to stick, it doesn't open and so I assume that someone is actually in there. I end up waiting in the living room for the person to leave, all the while really needing to go and not having another place to do so. I eventually realize no one is actually in there, when I see Alex and the other two roommates at the same time. I run in there to release what I'd been holding, but once I got out I let Alex have it. My roommates were supportive of me, as this is a recurring issue for all of us and we want to leave it open. Now, I probably went further than was reasonable and I take credit for that. I got mad about having to hold that dump in and wanted to let it out, but could've handled the response more maturely. However, I still think that it was ultimately reasonable for me to take issue with this. We offered an option that would keep the area closed to sight while still making it easy to get into, and Alex didn't take that. It's not like we're insisting on keeping it gaping open against their traditions. AITA for this?\",\n",

This year, he’s inviting me to come to his parents’ house for Christmas. I like his parents, but I must admit I don’t really want to go because (this may be shallow) I don’t think it will be as fun. My parents, for all their flaws, like to have a good time—there’s always lots of alcohol, great food, and general festivity at their house over the holidays. Even more importantly, Christmas week has always been a time for me and my sister (who live in different cities) to hang out and have fun. My boyfriend’s parents don’t drink, they don’t do anything special for holiday meals, and they live in a suburb far from fun activities. His sister and her husband have a just-turned-one-year-old, so the chances that we’re going to be able to go out and have fun with them are somewhat slim. More than anything, I’ll miss my sister.

It\\'s the first time we\\'ve hosted him for this long (usually he comes visit for just a weekend), and for such a long stay, differences in eating habits, cleanliness, helpfulness with chores, etc. are starting to clash (politely, but still). My girlfriend and I spend a few hours on Saturdays cleaning our apartment and cooking for the next few days.

I said \"sure but if \\\\[my girlfriend\\\\] is cleaning the kitchen, you should wait, or eat a banana or an apple\". I know that my girlfriend doesn\\'t want anyone in the way when she\\'s cleaning a room. She is using that time to call her family. Besides, I was already a bit annoyed that my brother hadn\\'t proposed to help, so to go as far as sitting in the kitchen eating a sandwich while she is cleaning, I found this rude. He doesn\\'t want a banana and would like bread and ham. I said \"ask \\\\[girlfriend\\\\] if you can, but don\\'t be surprised if she says no\". He went in the kitchen to ask. She was cleaning and calling her mom. The kitchen table was full of stuff (blender, soap, etc.) that she had just put aside, she would have needed to move them to make space for him, or let him use the counter, which she was cleaning. She pointed him to the fruit basket and, just like I did, told him he can have a fruit. He didn\\'t take anything. He came back to me and complained that we are \"extreme\" for not letting him have a sandwich, that he has never seen that anywhere, and that anyone would find it abnormal. I had no response. To me it sounded absolutely normal that if you are invited in someone\\'s home, especially for such a long stay, you don\\'t get in their way when they are busy cleaning. But my girlfriend\\'s mother had overheard on the phone when he had come into the kitchen, and told my girlfriend \"come on, let him have his sandwich, the poor thing will starve\", so she came out and told him he could have it. Now I\\'m not sure whether we are the AH for telling him no in the first place? EDIT to make it extra clear: I\\'m not expecting him to deep-clean our house. I\\'m expecting him to do the minimum (like putting his cup in the dishwasher, not making a mess that we have to clean after, etc.), I\\'m a bit annoyed that he doesn\\'t naturally chip in to help when he can, but mostly because that\\'s what I do when I\\'m invited somewhere (including his place). I see my host doing dishes? I\\'ll take a dishcloth and start drying them, for instance. Or if I\\'m staying several days, I\\'ll offer to cook a couple of meals. But my post was more about the specific situation of asking him not to go in the kitchen while my girlfriend was cleaning, v.s. my brother thinking he should be able to make himself a sandwich whenever he feels like (and I\\'m not even strict on that, he made himself a sandwich in the middle of the night, I have no issues with it).',\n",

I’m really proud of this place—it took years of saving, hard work, and sacrifice to get here. It’s small, but it’s mine, and I wanted to celebrate with a nice family dinner. I decided to make homemade spaghetti carbonara. I spent hours on it: crisped pancetta, freshly grated Parmesan, whisked with eggs and pasta water for a perfect, silky sauce. Carbonara is all about timing and texture, so I was in the kitchen paying close attention to every step. I added garlic bread, salad, and even made a cheesecake for dessert. It was a big effort, and I wanted the evening to feel special. Now, I keep a big jar of jellybeans on my coffee table as a treat. I love picking out a few here and there, and I always save the Cream Soda ones for last—they’re my favorite. The jar has lasted a long time, and it’s something I enjoy after a long day. My sister Laura (35F) brought her 7-year-old son, who’s honestly a bit of a handful. He’s not used to hearing “no” and thinks every space is his to do what he wants. My sister has never set limits with him, and growing up, our parents spoiled her too. While I was busy in the kitchen, my nephew found the jellybean jar. I didn’t notice at first because I was trying to get the carbonara just right. After dinner, I went to grab a handful of jellybeans and realized that almost all the Cream Soda ones were gone. My nephew had picked them out, leaving a mess of crumbs and broken bits. I pulled Laura aside and mentioned it, asking if she’d noticed. She just shrugged and said, “Oh, he only likes the Cream Soda ones, so he picked those out. No big deal.” I tried to be polite, but I told her that those were my favorites and asked if she could replace them, or at least get me some more of the Cream Soda flavor. She got annoyed and snapped, “He’s just a kid. You’re seriously this worked up over some jellybeans?” I told her it wasn’t about the jellybeans, but that it would’ve been nice if she’d kept an eye on him or taught him to ask. Laura rolled her eyes and said, “Then don’t leave temptations out if you don’t want kids touching them.” I asked her one more time to either replace the jar or just the Cream Soda ones, but she refused, calling me “petty” and saying I was blowing things out of proportion. My parents jumped in to back her up, telling me to “drop it” and that I should “know better than to have temptations out around kids.” But it’s not just about the money—it’s about respect and boundaries. I put a lot into that dinner, and her response was to let her son treat my place like his personal candy store. Now my family thinks I’m overreacting, but to me, this is about respecting boundaries. AITA for asking my sister to replace the Cream Soda jellybeans her son ate? Edit: I’ll accept my verdict since apparently it is normal these days to allow a child to root through a jar of jellybeans like a hog looking for truffles. What I won’t accept, what I won’t tolerate, is the insults about my competency as a home chef. Let me walk you through it, so you understand why real carbonara takes time and why cutting corners would be a disgrace. First, I went to this authentic Italian market with shelves stacked high with imported goods, where the scent of cured meats fills the air. They carry real pancetta, flown in weekly, and I spent ages with the owner, Domenico, who handpicked the perfect wedge of Parmigiano-Reggiano for me—a rich, nutty block that was almost too beautiful to grate. Next, I stopped at this tiny, family-owned shop that specializes in fresh farm eggs and produce. Carla, the owner, gets these eggs from a nearby farm, and each one is an intense, deep golden color, perfect for a creamy, rich sauce. Finally, I swung by a Salumeria for semolina flour. It sounds dramatic, but that’s the lengths I go for traditional pasta. The place feels like a rustic old-world bakery, with walls lined in wooden shelves and burlap sacks stacked high. Their semolina flour has a texture and richness that just doesn’t compare—ideal for handmade pasta that holds up with the perfect al dente bite. Back home, I crafted the pasta from scratch. Flour piled on the counter, eggs nestled into a well, kneading it with care until the dough was soft and elastic, a process that took a solid 15 minutes of arm work. Then, I let the dough rest before rolling it into long ribbons, each one dusted lightly with flour, like fresh snow. Finally, I crisped the pancetta, grated the cheese by hand, and whisked the eggs to the perfect consistency. The sauce had to be watched like a hawk—just enough heat to turn it creamy without scrambling, with careful additions of pasta water to reach that glossy, silken texture. So yes, it took hours. And I’m not ashamed to say that.',\n",

A vacation with two boys isn’t the most peaceful vacation in the world either. But she thinks I’m being sneaky . But the truth is I rather go do what I have to do , watch some tv in the hotel room without the boys screaming , smoke some weed and come back to my family in a couple days. I do enjoy the small periods alone but It’s not like I have some secret family I’m traveling to see nor am I planning trips to purposely get away but when it happens I do enjoy it by myself. This has caused suspicion and a riff in my household. Should I just tell her to come ? But wouldn’t that be more suspicious? Like she caught me ?

It's been really hard and this week was the breaking point for me. But I honestly still don't know but I just want to keep you informed because you live here and it would impact u as well OP: Alrighty thanks for letting me know. I hope everything works out tho. You do what you feel is best for you, don't worry about anyone else rn. Put yourself first. After I got this message I went out to tour apartments and figure where to live. I found one yesterday and submitted the documents needed to move in. I won't get an official confirmation for another week, but I decided to let my roommate know my plans. Later today I get a response from them saying how their text was purely hypothetical and was just ranting and that they weren't at all serious. I proceeded to tell them I had no way of knowing that it was hypothetical and that they seemed very serious. Then we argued for eight hours essentially. Starting with them being pissed off that I was even leaving in the first place. I had told them I planned to be out by November 22nd, but they wanted me to still pay them and their bf (roommate 3) for December rent. I replied with if I'm still there then I will, if I'm not I won't. I'm not on the lease at our current place, only them two are, so if anybody tips off management, we're all screwed. There was drama with our friend group as well that also lead to the roommates initial message. My roommate continued to try and belittle me because I am a push over essentially, but I wasn't having it today, so their tone changed into trying to guilt trip me into staying, saying how they can't afford it with them and their bf and yadayada. Begging me to stay even though they were the ones who put me in that same spot a few days ago, without any hint that they weren't serious about their first message.

On the way, my friend mentioned how heavy the books were when she picked them up the other day and suggested I ask my boyfriend for help, since he has a car. I told her the street is busy, and he’s a medical rep, often on the go. But after her suggestion, I decided to ask him anyway. I arrived with 30 minutes to spare, so I called him. I explained that it’d be great if he could help, but only if it was convenient for both of us, or if we could grab a beverage before or after work since I hadn’t seen him in a week. Otherwise no problem, I was planning to do it alone anyways. He insisted on helping, so we agreed I’d call when I was ready. Once I called, he picked me up basically from the bus stop I would wait at to take my bus and took us to a parking lot a minute away where they valet-parked his car. Half the books were in my backpack, and the rest were in a bag, so I grabbed only my phone and wallet, assuming we’d spend some time together. When I asked if I needed anything else, he told me to hurry so the valet could park the car. We walked for a bit, and then he asked, “So, what are you going to do now?” Surprised, I said, “I thought we’d hang out, so I just brought my phone and wallet.” He replied that he had to work so I said I’d just browse some shops, since I don't have my keys to go home and study. I followed for a bit until he reached the first doctor he would visit After saying goodbye, I wandered around for a couple of hours, hoping we’d meet up afterward. At 7, he called, saying he’d just finished work, so I suggested we go for a beverage. He said he thought it 8 and that he will continue working after all. We met at the parking lot, and he drove me home, but he didn’t come up to stay since he had gym at 9. At this point, I was a bit sad that I didn’t get to spend much time with him and I didn'tget to study, though I wasn’t mad—just a miscommunication. We brought the books upstairs, and when we got outside again, we hugged, kissed and I told him I missed him. He replied, “But hey, I helped you!”. I didn’t respond immediately, and not wanting to sound negative, I said, “I’m just glad I got to see you a bit!.” He pressed, “Didn’t I help?” I repeated myself. He got upset and frustrated, saying my response made him feel unappreciated, and that he just wanted to help. I thanked for the effort, but he seemed hurt, said goodbye, and drove off pretty much. Am I the asshole for not explicitly saying he helped? I feel like it would be lying, what happened didn’t feel helpful at all.

This morning around 6:45, I stopped by my local grocery store to grab some food before work. The parking spaces there are angled, making it easy to pull in, but they do follow a one-way traffic flow. I went up one lane and pulled through a space so my car’s nose was facing the driving lane—technically facing the 'wrong' direction. Since it was so early and the lot was practically empty, with literally hundreds of open spots, I figured it wouldn’t be an issue. As soon as I parked, though, I looked up to see a guy pull up nose-to-nose with my car. He started gesturing for me to back up and let him have the space, despite there being two open spots to my left and right. I just looked at him and shook my head slowly. He then reversed, parked in the space to my left, rolled down his window, and shouted, 'What the fuck are you doing, dumbass? You’re parked the wrong way!' I replied, 'Fuck you boomer there are 10,000 open parking spaces. You don't need this one that badly!' He got out, threw one final 'Fuck you' my way, to which I replied with 'Eat my asshole, old man!' and we both went inside, in opposite directions. So, Reddit, am I the asshole here? EDIT: Just so this is clear, because based on some comments it may not be. I was very obviously in the spot well before him. I didn’t like cut him off as he was going to it. The car was parked before he even pointed the nose of his car at mine. I beat him there by at least five seconds. He saw me in the ‘wrong’ place to park and wanted to start a feud. 2nd EDIT: The lot is not clearly marked as a one way. It’s just an unwritten rule that the slanted parking spots are supposed to be going one direction. People go the opposite way all the time. Not to mention I would definitely have gone (and did) the right direction when leaving EDIT 3: Anyone saying I’m the asshole for how I parked and not for telling the old fart to fuck off is insane.\",\n",

This results in other family members to pick up her holiday. It is frustrating and multiple people have talked to her about this. She bailed on hosting Easter but promised me that she would do Thanksgiving we swapped holidays.

Yesterday, we found a place we really liked and talked about how we'd figure out the lease by the end of the week. Today they've decided they want to sign the lease ASAP/by tonight because the landlord explained that the market is competitive and they don't want to lose this nice house... But, reading through the lease has made me realize I don't want to do this financially. Even with the 5 of us, this would cost me $750/month or $9k to live there for august 2025-july 2026, not counting utilities... and that is money that could go towards classes (I am paying for school by myself and just came back from a gap year of working. I do not want to take any loans and have a lot of anxieties about going into debt after college because it happened to mom and it still effects her). My family also lives close enough to campus that I can just stay with them without having to pay anything. These friends are all from out of town so they need to find a place to stay. I feel like a dick now for saying I don't think I can as soon as they are trying to sign the place, because I definitely could with the money I have saved, but I know I'll regret it in the future. I know I really don't want to, but feel like I have to because they don't have anyone else and they need 5 people. Right now I am banking on the fact that my parents refuse to co-sign, but I technically wouldn't need them because my credit score is better than the both of them. Do I continue to lie and say that my parents are the reason I can't sign? Most if not all of these places require us to have co-signers because we're so young, but my parents' financial history are so poor they don't think they'd be approved as co-signers I feel like an asshole because this is causing them a lot of anxiety, but it would be better for my own anxiety in the long run if I stayed at home and saved the money... I don't know how any of them are paying for school, so I feel awkward and kind of like an asshole for suddenly saying I couldn't afford it.

She also paid for a portion of my wife’s rent twice and she normally pays the bills if she and my wife go out for food. This friend is now marrying a doctor and I don’t think they have any trouble with paying for anything they want. My wife is a SAHM and I’m a mechanic. I bought home a bonus of $3k and when I told my wife she immediately started talking about getting her friend a really expensive necklace from this brand she knows her friend really wants. She showed me and the cheapest necklace is $2k on the website. She insisted I should spend the bonus on a wedding gift for her friend. I shut her down and told her it’s my bonus and she really cannot expect me to buy her friend something this expensive. I don’t think wedding gifts even exceed $100. She began fighting with me saying I buy lunch out of the house and I have stupid hobbies that cost a lot of money so why can’t she spend some money like buying her friend a necklace? I do spend a bit on my hobbies and I have 2 cars but I also work my ass off and her friend can definitely pay for it herself. She is marrying a doctor and they already have a house whereas we are still renting! I told her she is being insane and she insists we sit down and tally up everything I spent on myself in the last year and if it’s higher than 2k I should pay for the necklace. I think it’s ridiculous to compare the 2 and I’m refusing to let her buy her friend a ridiculously expensive gift. She insists her friend has spent a lot on her and I also saved money because her friend pays for meals and activities whenever they hang out so she doesn’t have to spend our money. I get that the lope sided relationship isn’t the best but then she should refuse to do anything that costs too much and let her friend decide if she wants to just hang out without doing anything that costs money. She refuses to talk to me now and I’m wondering if I’m the asshole here?',\n",

He’s in engineering and i’m in business. he had a paid internship this summer that paid him thousands of dollars each month. meanwhile my internship was free. I’ve come to notice that after he pays for one dinner or a meal, he conveniently “leaves his wallet” and has “0 battery” when we have to eat out/order restaurant food the next time and i have to pay for it. I have 0 problem paying for food after he has paid for the previous meal but he doesn’t even let me offer and imposes a sort of avoidable situation at me as to why he can’t pay for the particular meal and i have to pay for it. i thought i was overthinking but yesterday, on our 2 month mark, he was liek i wanna have a gourmet burger, not wendy’s, i thought he was going to pay for the food delivery, but then this voice inside me said “worst case scenario, i have to pay for our 2 month dinner”, which was fine with me because i was going to offer anyways but i just thought that yk usually it’s the guy who pays for big meals. anyways, he conveniently told me “im at 1% battery rn”, 3 hours before we ordered food online. when he told me that, i could see whatever he told me 3 hours later coming from a mile away. i told him to charge his phone asap because he was at home and his charger was right next to us. i offered to even give him his charger, he said no. instead, he proceeded to play a game on his phone, causing it to die. then after 3 hours, he said “babe you’ll have to order food today, i’m out of energy”, i expected that from a mile away. and he was fully expecting me to pay for his $30 each burger when he came up with that lame excuse. to test that theory out, i said “im tired too, not in the mood to eat”. lie. right after i said that, he was literally not the same person anymore. he was full of energy and even told me to stay awake, “the night has just started”. I was right, it was just an excuse to not spend any money. the worst part is that i was going to offer ordering it anyways but i just wanted to test my theory, and i was supposedly right. I was hungry anyways and i wasn’t gonna rely on him to get me anything. i ended up ordering a plain cheese pizza cuz i ain’t buying that man a gourmet burger liek i originally planned to if need be because he has done this so many times before. like he knew we were going to eat and he has conveniently forgotten his wallet and phone so many times. AITA not ordering my bf the food of his choice? EDIT: HE IS REALLY REALLY SWEET BUT THIS IS THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE. HE IS VERY NICE OTHERWISE. AND HE DOES PAY FOR MEALS, IT’S FOR SUBSEQUENT MEALS WHEN HE ACTS LIKE THIS. EDIT + mini update: hey guys, i do agree that im being sort of immature as well, i did send him a text upon one of y’all’s suggestions: “hey babe, don’t get mad but i’ve been observing something, you know I don’t mind paying for our meals, or taking turns paying, right? I’ve been feeling like you’ve been trying to create a reason you can’t pay, maybe so as not to hurt my feelings? If so, I’d really just prefer it if you could just ask me to cover this one like beginning of us hanging out on that specific day, or wait for me to offer. like i have no problem.

Tell him you're happy to take turns paying, you want to take turns paying, but the way he manipulates you into it each time is very off-putting. Talk about who pays for what and when, and bring up that you have disparate financial situations that need to be taken into account. Whoever is paying should be the one deciding where to eat. Otherwise I get the feeling he'd want a $30 burger when it's your turn to pay and McDonald's when it's his turn to pay. If he pouts or has a tantrum or starts throwing around accusations that would be a red flag. Also the way he thought you were tired and immediately wanted to get up and go, instead of wanting you to lie down and rest, is making me side-eye him.\"},\n",

Since we took our relationship to the next level, we decided to not renew our lease with our roommate and get our own spot. During the past 6 months of living together, just us two and my cat, I mostly get a ton of packages sent to our door. Whenever I place orders, especially through Amazon, I always give my husband a heads up. Not for any other reason. Yesterday, I gave him a heads up that I was ordering 3 things for my sibling. I was the first to get home today and noticed 3 packages. I ordered my sibling semi big things, and immediately opened up the boxes to wash before I head their way tonight. Shortly after opening the first box, I noticed a bright color that couldn’t have been what I ordered. I quickly checked the address, it was addressed to my husband, and I set it aside and continued to open the other 2 boxes. Somehow Amazon figured out a way to condense my order only into 2 packages. I thought nothing of it. My husband and I then had our daily ‘after-work’ phone call, where we discuss what happened throughout our days and he quickly threw out that he should have a package waiting for him. I then told him I accidentally opened it, but set it aside for him to completely open when he got home. The conversation then took a turn when he began to scold me about opening his packages. I reminded him of my order and explained to him that it wasn’t intentional. That I was just expecting my orders for my sibling and wanted to prepare their stuff before I gave it to them later. This explanation wasn’t good enough. My husband made it seem that I was being negligent, and that “common sense is to look at the address before opening any package or mail”. Although I agree with this, I don’t feel like it’s necessary when the packages are delivered to OUR door. I was expecting the package and opened it because I thought it was mine. I also feel since we are married, it shouldn’t matter that I opened the package on accident. It’s not like I took everything out. I simply took my key swiped it across the tape and noticed it wasn’t mine, and set it aside. After arguing in circles, his solution was for me to check every label before opening anything and my solution is a heads up after placing an order. I told him I’ll work on looking at the label, but he thinks it’s unnecessary to tell me when he’s expecting a package. We left the conversation annoyed at each other. I know this issue is so minute, but he really thinks that I’m lacking common sense. So like, AITA?!',\n",

My mom taught me when I was a kid, and over time, it’s become “my thing.” I make it for all sorts of occasions—birthdays, family gatherings, and even just nights in with friends. Everyone raves about it, and I take a lot of pride in keeping it close to the original. One of my closest friends, Emily, recently asked me for the recipe. She’s been experimenting in the kitchen lately and thought it would be fun to try making it herself. At first, I kind of laughed it off, saying something like, “Oh, maybe I’ll teach you someday,” but she kept pressing. Emily isn’t Italian and doesn’t have a lot of experience cooking from scratch, so I was a little hesitant. It felt weird giving away something that feels so tied to my family, especially since my mom always treated it as a bit of a “family-only” thing. I tried explaining that it was a family recipe, and I didn’t feel comfortable giving it out. She got pretty annoyed, saying it was just sauce and not some “huge family heirloom.” She pointed out that I’d shared recipes with her before (which is true, but those were random ones I found online, not family recipes). Now things are awkward between us. She’s been short with me ever since and even made a snarky comment at a dinner party about how I “gatekeep sauce.” A few mutual friends think I should’ve just given it to her to avoid drama, but others understand why I wanted to keep it private.

Last friday my Wife and I took our 2 kids under 3 to the playground in our neighborhood park. This was a rare Friday where there were no commitments as we usually take them first thing in the morning. As we approached we noticed there were probably a dozen kids there and 2 large labs running in the grassy area unleashed. My wife and I are like the dogs shouldn't be there unleashed but our little guy was excited to be at the playground. So we continued. We let our boy run around and the younger one we put in the swing. Some parents that were there started talking to us. They are essentially one big neighborhood parent group and meet up weekly. I didn't know anyone in this group. My son climbed a structure and went down a slide. Once he was off the slide there were no kids on that structure. A lady that had the 2 dogs there (I still don't know if she was a parent), let the dogs onto the playground structure and let them go down the slide. I spoke up to this lady and told her to keep her dogs off the equipment. She told me they were her service dogs. I said, i don't think service dogs play on playground equipment. She snaps back to me service dogs are allowed to take breaks. She continues saying that we are here every week and no one has ever complained. I say that not everyone is comfortable around dogs and tell her I think its selfish to let your dogs on the equipment especially when children are around. Some parents support her and said as much to my wife and I. She told me that I should make sure my kids are comfortable around dogs before bringing them around dogs. I told this lady that she was insane and completely missed my point. My wife and I left after this. We noticed a facebook post about us (that we have not engaged) and it seems its 50/50 on if we are the assholes.\",\n",

       " '1gjc9pm': {'description': 'So I am the events chair of my fraternity for the semester and I planned out a Halloween party that happened yesterday. At the party we typically have a huge costume contest. You pay 5 dollars to enter and if you win, you win the pot. We usually pull about 30 to 50 entries. So the prize is pretty nice. This year we had 40 people enter and about 160 people attending. In years past, the winner has been this one specific chick That my brothers wanna fuck. Her costume is usually the typical sorority girl costume (an animal of some kind, boots, fishnet leggings, a short skirt, basically a bra or corset, and then animal ears and light face paint). Now I’m not a Halloween nazi. This year my costume was literally just a angel wings, and white shorts, and a halo. I know fully that I’m dressing up so hot guys that think I’m hot will take notice and that it’s not a “good costume”. Her costume isn’t good. Sure, she looks good in it. But the point of the party is who has the best breasts So we have the contest, and she’s wearing her MO. She was a bee, but her ass was hanging out and her boobs were about to fall out of her shirt. So we held the contest, people voted anonymously, and guess what. She won. But by one vote. I hadn’t voted yet, so I simply casted my vote then my vice chairman, who agreed with me casted his vote. That just happened to be enough to put her at second place. When I told my by brothers they bitched and moaned about it, but I told them she simply didn’t win and she should do better next year. They eventually talked me into creating a runner up prize of 50 dollars to the girl. When we announced the winner, she was visibly upset. This was the first time she hasn’t won in the last 4 years. Now apparently, last night one of my brothers was simping hard and told her that I intentionally voted against her because I didn’t like her (not true, I’m genuinely apathetic about her). She found me later that night and cursed me out and said I had a problem with her. I told her simply that we weren’t having a sluttiest costume contest, but a best costume contest and that she’s lucky we bent the rules to give her 50 bucks. We argued and ended up getting separated. Now a lot of my brothers are pissed at me for pissing her off.',\n",

We became close after she experienced a traumatic event and I wanted to support her due to my own experience with abuse. We fell in love quickly despite our pasts.

However, she often threatens to end the relationship when she gets upset, causing stress for me. Halloween night, we were having fun at my house. I was trying to clean up before bed, but I was in a lot of pain due to a back injury. I commented \"I feel like a maid.\" She instantly got upset. I calmed her down and apologized, telling her I\\'m in pain so everything feels harder than normal. She asked for a ride to get clothes for work the next day, but I\\'d been drinking and didn\\'t feel safe driving. She said she felt fine, asking to drive my car instead. I agreed, telling her to text me when she was on her way back. She took all her things with her, which seemed odd since she coming back. After falling asleep briefly, I woke up to find her gone and a text saying she wouldn\\'t be returning my car, but would pick me up for work in the morning. I tried calling her but it went straight to voicemail and she wasn\\'t answering my texts. With a spare car and house key, I decided to take an Uber to her apartment so we could talk. I quickly learned she suspended my access code to get into the apartment complex. I was locked out and unable to contact her.

I explained she can\\'t keep it without permission. I said \"you knew you weren\\'t coming back when you took all her things last night.\" Her response was \"so!\" I stated she should\\'ve taken an Uber instead.

She called 38 times and texted repeatedly, asking if I had the car, but I ignored her. After 45 min, I called her revealing I had taken it last night to teach her a lesson. She was furious! Saying \"never contact me again, please get help!\" At this point she still had my car keys with my house/mail/parents\\' keys attached to them. Asking her to bring them back, she ignored me by putting her phone on do not disturb. I warned her I\\'d call the police if she didn\\'t return them. After waiting and getting no response, I called the police to help. They couldn\\'t come for hours due to being busy. Worried that she may have thrown my keys away, I changed the lock on my front door. Later that day, she returned my keys, including the spare key I gave her, leaving them on my doorstep. I only saw her back as she was leaving, but she seemed sad. Am I the ass hole for trying to teach her a lesson? Would you have been upset if you were me?

The trip was a tour of several cities, visiting family and exploring. Things went well until the last city, where I planned to meet my dad (who raised me after my parents divorced) and some aunts. My wife mentioned she had a friend in town she might see, and I was fine with that. But when we arrived, she got sick and felt terrible, so she wanted to stay in bed and insisted I go see my family without her. I stayed with her for a bit, got her food, and told her to reach out if she needed anything. I visited some friends and later returned to the Airbnb that night. The next day, she was still unwell, and again urged me to go meet family. I had lunch with my aunt, who was asking me about my wife and even suggested medicine for her when I told her she was sick. After lunch I told my aunt I was going back to the Airbnb to check on my wife, and on my way there I texted her asking how she was feeling to which she replied she was still very sick and with a massive headache. She told me to stay out, to go and enjoy my time in the city, so I decided to walk around my old neighborhood and eventually met up with my dad at a mall. That’s when my wife texted, saying that her friend had texted her saying he wanted to meet up with her and go grab a coffee, and she pretty much said that since her friend lives in Florida and now they happened to be in the same city she did not want to lose on the opportunity, this happened around 5 p.m. I was surprised but told her okay. I was with my dad until 11 p.m. and then I went back to the Airbnb. She was not there yet when I arrived and ended up coming back at around 1 a.m. On our last day, my family invited us to breakfast. I got ready early, and my wife suddenly felt better and wanted to join. I told her it felt too late—she had chosen not to meet them before, so I went alone.

When his parents got divorced, his father moved back to Greece, and because Niko has always had a strained relationship with his father, they don't talk or see each other very much - but they tend to get together to have dinner whenever he's back in the UK. This time he was back for a month and he rented out an apartment and so he invited around the both of us around - he didn't specify that we were going to eat anything, just said we could have a few drinks and chat. I've only met him once or twice before now, and I didn't see any reason not to do so and figured that it would be some good backup for Niko if he wanted to leave early or anything. So we went around yesterday at around 9pm. When we got there, FIL had made a traditional Greek dish called spanakopita (sort of like a pie but it's made with filo pastry, it has spinach and feta). For context, I have a history of anorexia, and eating in front of people that I don't really know is still an issue for me, and anything with pastry is something that I tend to avoid even now. He was pleasant enough, welcomed us all in and offered us the food, and I said no thank you because I was anxious with the situation. Niko caught on that I was uncomfortable and so told his dad that we'd already eaten, but his dad kept insisting that we should try it. At us saying no again, he got very up in arms about how he'd gone to the effort of making the food, and that it shouldn't be such an issue for us to just have some of it, and that he felt as though we were disrespecting him by refusing to eat the food. So husband and I apologised, offered to stay for drinks, but ultimately left as he remained angry about the situation. I know I could have explained why I didn't want to eat it, but I felt uncomfortable trauma dumping on him about the real reason why, or I could have tried a little bit and then just left it and he probably would have been fine.
