Post,1grc8a6,AITA for not giving my late husband’s mom any of the life insurance money after she paid for his funeral?,Icy-Sun6781,2024-11-14 18:56:10,"My first and hopefully last throwaway account. 

My husband and I were both in our early 40s, married for 6 years, when he passed away suddenly a few months ago. It’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever faced, and honestly, I’ve just been trying to survive each day since. Right after he died, his mom (my MIL) stepped in and insisted on paying for all the funeral expenses. I was completely out of it, just in a fog, and really grateful for the help.

Here’s the thing: I totally forgot that my husband had a small life insurance policy through my job. I only remembered it recently and filed a claim, getting a payout. It’s not a huge amount of money, but enough to help me move back across the country to be with my family and maybe put something down on a modest home so I can start over.

When my MIL found out about the insurance payout, she flipped out. She’s demanding I pay her back for the funeral costs and accusing me of ‘using’ her son. She’s said some really hurtful things, calling me selfish and implying I’m somehow profiting off his death. But she offered to pay for the funeral, and I truly didn’t know about the insurance money at the time. I’m still so broken over losing him, and the thought of being called heartless just adds to the pain.

I know she’s grieving too, but I’m trying to do what’s best for me to heal and move forward. So, AITA if I don’t give her the money? I’m already barely holding it together and just need a chance to rebuild my life.

I’m ready, I hope- to handle the criticism that may be coming my way. ",7253,2931,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1grc8a6/aita_for_not_giving_my_late_husbands_mom_any_of/,"The final verdict is: **Everyone Sucks**

When you found out that you were going to be getting a payout from the insurance company, IMO you should have let her know and offered to pay her back for the funeral expenses.  Whether she chose to accept it or not is up to her, but I think the right thing would be to at least offer, even if some time had passed by that point.  

Sounds to me though like she said some pretty cruel stuff, seems like she crossed the line.

On the plus side, you probably won't have to talk to her ever again anyways.",12198,0,,,ESH,

As a daughter, I paid for a large portion of my mom’s memorial service. As a mom? I would absolutely pay for my sons’. Life insurance, yes, is partially to help pay for funerals/cremation or burial. But, more importantly, it is also to make sure that the surviving spouse and/or children can manage without that person’s income for a period of time. While I do think it might be right to provide her with some reimbursement, the fact is that she offered to pay for it. Every adult should have life insurance and I have a hard time believing she assumed her son had none.",1180,0,,,NTA,

So many people just assume OP told MIL she couldn’t pay for the funeral so MIL offered and now is in need of the payout OP received. That is a bold assumption! OP mentions in a comment that she would have been able to pay for a funeral and WOULD HAVE DONE SO, HAD MIL NOT OFFERED! 

A mother might want to make decisions about her child’s funeral, and the best way to do that is to arrange it all, AND PAY FOR IT. This does not reflect on OP’s ability to pay for it, or any insurance money OP may or may not receive in case of a spouses death. 

OP, you are NTA. It is completely up to you if you want to give MIL some money to reimburse her for the funeral costs, but she offered, you did not ask. It is your choice. I’m very sorry for your loss and I hope moving back to where your family lives will help you heal!",816,0,,,NTA,

She offered to pay for a funeral FOR HER SON. It's not like it was for some random person. Unless she opted to spend excessive amounts, which it sounds like you wouldn't have done, I'm not sure why she's even that upset.    

The Life Insurance is to help the spouse recover and keep living a normal life.   I probably would have offered to repay, at least part of it... But on the flip side, I would also turn down being repaid as you need that money to move forward.

I can't imagine a world where I would offer to pay for a funeral and then demand to be repaid later.

I disagree with what a life insurance policy should be used for.  You no longer have a husband to help pay for a house or car or life together.  Your income may have dropped by half or more.  Your MIL can afford to pay for the funeral or she would not have offered.  Build your life.  Life your life.,1909,0,,,NTA,

Both of you are grieving, and it's common for people who are grieving to be a bit...not selfish, but self-centered as a way to protect themselves. I don't think you are a selfish person. But you are only thinking about yourself, which is understandable in a crisis.

Here's the thing. Funerals are not cheap, and his mother had to pay for the funeral and *was supporting you*. The least you can do is reimburse her.

I am genuinely sorry for both of your losses and I hope that the relationship was not damaged by this misstep, as you both will need each other. It's okay if you need to tell her that you needed to hear from some peers to realize the mistake.",2445,0,,,YTA,

I’m kind of surprised at all the YTA comments.  Unless you made comments about not being able to afford the funeral or something of the like that inspired her to offer to pay for the funeral, I think you’re NTA. 

You’re missing income from your husband’s death going forward, not profiting off it. That money will help you transition to being on your own which is hard and scary. While it might have been a nice gesture to Offer to pay her back when you remembered the policy, I don’t think it was your responsibility to do so unless you think paying caused her hardship or she only offered because she thought you had no money.

Presumably this was a benefit through *your* employer, not your husband's employer. Therefore, to me, it belongs completely to you and should be used for your benefit.

I can see the insurance money paying for the cost of the necessary expenses of death, burial, etc and it would seem fit to reimburse MIL for costs OP would have been required to pay. 

Also- what was MIL’s relationship with her son and the OP? Those points could have a different response knowing more of the relational factors with the parties involved. 

OP responded that MIL wasn’t really involved with her son so perhaps it was guilt that motivated her to offer to pay for the funeral.

Life insurance is meant to help the beneficiary - you - make up for the lost income and security that having a living partner affords. It's not necessarily for the funeral expenses, which come out of the estate itself, unless someone else offers to pay.

When you lose a spouse, you lose your home's income and earning potential. Life insurance is meant to help keep you afloat and able to live at a decent standard. You're using the money for its intended purpose. It's not ""using"" the person who died. She is way out of line for saying that. 

NTA. 

Also, I'm very sorry for your loss. My husband died at 30 just over 2 years ago, and I just used the life insurance toward a down payment on a condo. I feel you. The pain does get a bit lighter, and the fog eventually starts to lift. Keep surviving <3",86,0,,,NTA,

First of all sorry for your loss and hope you are doing the best that can be expected 


As the next of kin it was your financial responsibility to pay for the funeral so why did his mom?Once you remembered about the policy, why wouldnt you immediately OFFER to repay her for the funeral expense, since it was your responsibility to begin with? 


 Also you are in your 40s with lots of years left to earn income.  The money your MIL paid for the funeral likely came out of her savings and since she is most likely retired she will have no way of earning money to replace the money she spent on his funeral.


 You said you had an insurance policy on your husband.  Did your husband not have an insurance policy or 401 K as well? Did you and your husband own a home together that you could sell and use the funds to start over. 


 You dont mention whether you and your husband  had any kids together or whether he had any prior to marrying you.  But if you had kids together, it might be good to repay his mother for the funeral expenses so not paying her back wont be an issue that could cause her to not want to be involved in her grandchild's life.",557,0,,,YTA,

It was a huge mess because I wanted to bury her and the town we lived for the past 15 years and raised our kids, they wanted to bury her where she grew up and her family is. Long story short operator in our town so our two kids could visit once they were old enough. They were 5 and 8 when she passed.
I ended up putting a picture of her in the two boys on the gravestone but had to wait 6 months for the ground to settle.. during that time I cannot tell you how many phone calls and texts I would forget each day from them fussing that I had not put a headstone up yet..
It has been several years now and we all get along a lot better than during that moment..
Grief can cause a family to melt down to its core...

My ex-husband died suddenly from a stroke at age 28.  We were divorced at the time because of substance abuse issues.  However, after a couple years apart we got back together and we were working on our relationship when he died.

Because we weren’t married at the time of his death that meant his parents got the insurance payout from his employer.  His parents are divorced so it went 50/50 between them.

However, his dad was completely non-responsive and wouldn’t engage in funeral/burial discussions.  His mom wanted the cheapest possible option, basic cremation.

I wanted a burial.  So I paid for it, even though I didn’t get any of the insurance money.  I was upset about it, and to this day I still believe his parents should have reimbursed me.

His mom did end up paying me about 25% of the cost of the burial. So it’s something I guess.

Anyway I guess I didn’t really address your question.  Just empathizing.  Loss is horrible, and grief can make people say and do things they wouldn’t normally.

I think you should ask yourself what would your husband want? Would he have wanted you to pay his mother from the life insurance?  Maybe reflect on that, but know that this is an awful situation all around and you shouldn’t feel guilty about whichever path you take.

Anyone offers to pay ""for anything"" then comes back and asks for it back due to a small windfall is not right!   

Someone offers to pay for a party and then 6 months later asks for the money back.    

If MIL offered to help this is on her accord.    If MIL did not have the means, she would not have offered.   If MIL was expecting repayment, it would have been presented as such.   

As far as life insurance is suppose to be for funeral costs - I disagree as I do not see it this way.   This may be why some have it and for others it is for the beneficiary for whatever reasons.       

OP took out the life insurance through her job and she can choose how to use it.  *********If OP took it out so she could relocate that is enough of a reason to keep it. **********************

Post,1grl6av,AITA for suggesting my teacher host my son's party at her house?,Better-Ad9523,2024-11-15 01:40:59,"Throwaway and fake names. I realize this was probably very petty but I want to see if I am justified or just an asshole and owe an apology.

My son ""Sam"" had his ninth birthday today, but we're having the actual ""party"" tomorrow night, which is basically just a sleepover at our apartment with two friends. One is in his class and the other in a different one(same school though). Before my son even got home from the bus I got a call from his teacher ""Lorna"" requesting that the party involve all the students in the class. She learned about it because it came up as the class wished him a happy birthday. I at first politely refused, saying that's not reasonable but she insisted to make sure nobody was left out. I respond by saying that she has no say in who is at my home ever and that even if she did, my apartment simply cannot accommodate 32 kids and guardians. She says that because other students are involved, she does and that I should have the party somewhere that can allow all students.

  
I was ready to either hang up or tell her off, but what she said at the end sparked an idea. I tell her ""Okay, what's your address?"" and when she asks why, I told that since you think you have a say and you want all your students to be a part, we might as well have the party have her house, and request her address again. There's a pause before she says that's not exactly what she meant and I tell her that no, she wants everyone to attend so she should be the one to make it work, before hanging up.

This is where I probably became the asshole. Out of curiosity I easily found her address(her SM is not private at all) and email her ""how does this email sound?"" with an excerpt to the group email chain saying that Lorna has offered to host Sam's birthday party at her home and to come after school to X address. I was NOT planning on actually sending that to anyone else but her, I just wanted to prove the point and felt I was being sarcastic but I know tone is hard online. She responded to not send it and to do whatever I want for the birthday, she does not care anymore.

When I vented to my husband about it he called me unhinged but he agreed with my point. I'll admit, I have a bit of a habit going overboard when I feel wronged and probably went nuts, but I can't believe the audacity of this lady.

As a teacher, wow. Wild. Lorna is part of the broken education system. It's unfortunate that your kid landed in her room, but I hope this was a random one-off and that she is typically a good teacher. 

However, you quickly went from being deeply justified and right to possibly opening yourself up to legal ramifications... especially with the paper trail evidence you so willingly created. Public schools teachers have protections and rights. You may have ventured into territory that can range from banning from all school property and events up to and including restraining orders, PFAs, and charges. (Flip the script, in the teachers sub reddit, if this was posted from Lorna's POV, there would be 100s of comments suggesting ""forward to admin, union along with all communications and documentation of parent"" and from a union rep perspective, I've encouraged staff to pursue all legal paths to protect their teaching license and certifications.)

The old adage hits true here: two wrongs don't make a right. I tell my students comply, then complain. The second you pop off (like researching, premediating, her address--doubtful her home address is listed on her Facebook, Instagram, etc... you looked elsewhere), you eliminate any real, justified complaint you had. 

Sooner rather than later, you need to send an extremely sincere apology, explanation of being caught off guard and reactive to her request, recognize that things could have been handled better by both parties, BUT most importantly, this miscommunication between adults should not affect the learning environment for any of the students in the room.

They probably just didn’t want to be told off by their boss/have another parent complain but she definitely overstepped in insisting if you calmly and clearly explained the situation. 

You went nuclear in response though. You have completely imploded the relationship with the person who spends like 6 hours a day, 180 days this year charged with your child’s wellbeing and progress. Hopefully she’s like the vast majority of teachers who entered the profession as a vocation so wouldn’t dream of taking this out on your child. However it could prompt her to create a report about you in school (if not potentially beyond), ask to have your child moved from her class, have you removed as a parent if private school, tell every other teacher in school about you creating a terrible reputation for you/your family, or at the very least, it will cloud every communication she has with you and make her VERY hesitant to ever communicate with you about anything in the future in case you fly off the handle.

I mean... asking her to do it at hers got your point across. The e-mail was just beating the dead horse to be extra.

Is the teacher an idiot? Yes. Decidedly. Their job ends when the kids go home unless there's distinct signs a child needs assistance beyond that (abusive households and the like). Trying to dictate someone's child's birthday party is insane.


But if you were upset enough to write up that e-mail, you could have made it one that goes to the principal instead and details the teacher's problematic behaviour so she'd get reprimanded.


You picked the high schooler response over the adult one and no matter how ""funny"" that is in theory, in practice all you've done is made it so neither you nor the teacher can enter an interaction normally ever again (or at least until this is settled properly).

Throwaway and fake names. I realize this was probably very petty but I want to see if I am justified or just an asshole and owe an apology.

My son ""Sam"" had his ninth birthday today, but we're having the actual ""party"" tomorrow night, which is basically just a sleepover at our apartment with two friends. One is in his class and the other in a different one(same school though). Before my son even got home from the bus I got a call from his teacher ""Lorna"" requesting that the party involve all the students in the class. She learned about it because it came up as the class wished him a happy birthday. I at first politely refused, saying that's not reasonable but she insisted to make sure nobody was left out. I respond by saying that she has no say in who is at my home ever and that even if she did, my apartment simply cannot accommodate 32 kids and guardians. She says that because other students are involved, she does and that I should have the party somewhere that can allow all students.

  
I was ready to either hang up or tell her off, but what she said at the end sparked an idea. I tell her ""Okay, what's your address?"" and when she asks why, I told that since you think you have a say and you want all your students to be a part, we might as well have the party have her house, and request her address again. There's a pause before she says that's not exactly what she meant and I tell her that no, she wants everyone to attend so she should be the one to make it work, before hanging up.

This is where I probably became the asshole. Out of curiosity I easily found her address(her SM is not private at all) and email her ""how does this email sound?"" with an excerpt to the group email chain saying that Lorna has offered to host Sam's birthday party at her home and to come after school to X address. I was NOT planning on actually sending that to anyone else but her, I just wanted to prove the point and felt I was being sarcastic but I know tone is hard online. She responded to not send it and to do whatever I want for the birthday, she does not care anymore.

When I vented to my husband about it he called me unhinged but he agreed with my point. I'll admit, I have a bit of a habit going overboard when I feel wronged and probably went nuts, but I can't believe the audacity of this lady. AITA.

Post,1grf6ll,AITA for thanking my wife for her bday present? ,PromotionSafe2680,2024-11-14 21:02:15,"So my wife told me not to look at any mail or packages because she ordered me a birthday gift (didn’t even want one but that’s another conversation). We live in an apartment building so sometimes the packages either go to my front door or the front entrance. If it’s small, it will go in our mailbox. 

Anyways, I’m taking out the trash in my apartment building and see a red package in the front entrance for famous footwear with my address on it. 

I didn’t open the package. I didn’t look for it. I didn’t open the mailbox. It’s not my fault the brand is on the box. 

I send it to my wife and said “thanks for the shoes.” I didn’t think it would blow up. Maybe this is where I fucked up. 

I don’t open the package but clearly it’s some sort of shoe. I didn’t expect her to get mad but she got furious. 

She said “I told you not to look.” 

“Why do you have to put your nose in everything.” 

Maybe 30-40 more texts come. 

She starts calling me names and compared me to her cousins boyfriend, who apparently would never do this. 

Now she’s not talking to me. I didn’t even want a gift. I told her no gifts. 

Am I the asshole? 

EDIT: If she really wanted to surprise me, couldn’t she just send it to her sisters or friends place? I also prefaced I don’t want presents. I did exactly as she asked, did not look intentionally for anything.

So my wife told me not to look at any mail or packages because she ordered me a birthday gift (didn’t even want one but that’s another conversation). We live in an apartment building so sometimes the packages either go to my front door or the front entrance. If it’s small, it will go in our mailbox. 

Anyways, I’m taking out the trash in my apartment building and see a red package in the front entrance for famous footwear with my address on it. 

I didn’t open the package. I didn’t look for it. I didn’t open the mailbox. It’s not my fault the brand is on the box. 

I send it to my wife and said “thanks for the shoes.” I didn’t think it would blow up. Maybe this is where I fucked up. 

I don’t open the package but clearly it’s some sort of shoe. I didn’t expect her to get mad but she got furious. 

She said “I told you not to look.” 

“Why do you have to put your nose in everything.” 

Maybe 30-40 more texts come. 

She starts calling me names and compared me to her cousins boyfriend, who apparently would never do this. 

Now she’s not talking to me. I didn’t even want a gift. I told her no gifts. 

Am I the asshole?

I find it so incredibly rude that your wife specifically asked you not to look at the packages as she had a suprise for you and the first thing you do is look as well as text her and rub it in her face. A loving partner would either avoid looking in that direction or if you did accidentally notice it just pretend you didn't see it so she can still have that moment. Her getting you a gift after you said you didn't want one doesn't seem like a huge deal. I would just appreciate the lovely thought even if I had said I'd be fine without any gifts.  Honestly, you come off as a big jerk. Even your edit is rude.

They’re married and the wife is buying presents for her husband. I’m going to make an assumption here that the relationship probably isn’t all that bad.

Now since the present came with an indicator of what it is… it’s kind of hard for OP to not know what it is. All he knows is it’s a shoe. It would be unreasonable for it to be his fault for knowing that it’s a shoe. He had no malicious intent or even a want to spoil the surprise. That’s a product of circumstance. 

Now sending the image to the wife was purely unlucky and is just another life lesson to be experienced. OP could probably have done it better by just sending a text but sending the image would have made the wife assume that it was opened and mare her feel like her efforts wasted. Now that sucks 100% but you can’t call the guy an asshole just for that. He never even opened the package.

OP I think just calmly explain that you were a bit unlucky and never meant to ruin your surprise. The logo was there and there was nothing you could do about it. It’s like if someone told you to listen to a new song but you already heard it while standing at the shops and you didn’t even know that was the new song. The wife overreacted but don’t tell her that. Be calm ,acknowledge her feelings which is a hard thing to do as a guy but it’s gotta be done, and explain you never intended to hurt her it was just out of ur control. Explain that if it was up to you then you wished you had never seen it at all and thank her again for the gift (don’t mention you never wanted a gift that won’t help hahaha)

She gets more things, spends more money when out without being reprimanded. My mom (45F) pays very little attention to her social life, while my friends are almost always a topic of conversation. She gets away with almost everything, and my mom even got mad at me for sending a meme she didn't understand (100% appropriate for her to see, nothing bad at all).

Recently, my mom took me and my friend to a theme park near our house (about an hour drive away). I've only been one time before with some family friends, and my sister has been about 5 times with her friends.

The whole time before we left to pick up my friend, my mom was telling me not to mention it to her. She knew we were going, but my mom didn't want her to be jealous. The times my sister went with her friends, she bragged about it a ton. To clarify, her friends invited her to go, not the other way around.

After I got back (we were gone for roughly 6 hours, but my sister had sports my dad took her to), my sister was upset she wasn't able to go. The park was closing for the season soon, and she wouldn't be able to go.

Now, my mom has been making plans to take her and someone because she got so jealous of me. I tried to talk to her about how it was unfair, and she had already been many more times than me, despite me liking roller coasters more. She told me that she was ""giving us equal opportunity"". I told her that if I were the one who was jealous, I would have to ""deal with jt"" because I'm older, and told her she clearly favors my sister. My mom blew up, and now my family is angry with me.

Your mother **is not** responsible for things that your sister gets from her friends and their mothers. 


What you are asking for from your mother - namely that she gives you something and gkvesbyour sister nothing - would actually be favouritism of you.


To make a comparison - imagine if you were to get a paper route or parttime job that gives you £50 per week. Since you get £50 per week from working and your sister doesn't, your mother decides to start giving your mother £50 per week but doesn't give you a penny. Does this hypothetical scenario sound fair to you? After all, you both end up with £50 per week... except that your mothet is giving your sister £50 per week and giving you nothing. 


I really hope that this hypothetical might give you at least some idea of how this situation actually is when you look at it with a little more perspective. As others have pointed out, you're young, the teenage years are just a mess of stress and anxiety and hormones, and with amy luck in a week you'll be over it.

I, 15F, have a sister, 13F, and she's always been treated better than me. I try to brush it off, but it's getting more obvious.

She gets more things, spends more money when out without being reprimanded. My mom (45F) pays very little attention to her social life, while my friends are almost always a topic of conversation. She gets away with almost everything, and my mom even got mad at me for sending a meme she didn't understand (100% appropriate for her to see, nothing bad at all).

Recently, my mom took me and my friend to a theme park near our house (about an hour drive away). I've only been one time before with some family friends, and my sister has been about 5 times with her friends.

The whole time before we left to pick up my friend, my mom was telling me not to mention it to her. She knew we were going, but my mom didn't want her to be jealous. The times my sister went with her friends, she bragged about it a ton. To clarify, her friends invited her to go, not the other way around.

After I got back (we were gone for roughly 6 hours, but my sister had sports my dad took her to), my sister was upset she wasn't able to go. The park was closing for the season soon, and she wouldn't be able to go.

Now, my mom has been making plans to take her and someone because she got so jealous of me. I tried to talk to her about how it was unfair, and she had already been many more times than me, despite me liking roller coasters more. She told me that she was ""giving us equal opportunity"". I told her that if I were the one who was jealous, I would have to ""deal with jt"" because I'm older, and told her she clearly favors my sister. My mom blew up, and now my family is angry with me. So, AITA?

Also, OP is showing a bit of immaturity by assuming that being treated differently is inherently bad or something that can be avoided. That’s a very juvenile perspective. Parents are human too. They can try their best to be fair, but it’s impossible to treat each child the same all the time. Parents change over time—your mom today isn’t the same person your sister will get in the future. Different circumstances, different phases in life, and different children all lead to different decisions. If anything, I think the parents should focus on addressing the underlying insecurity and competition between the sisters, which seems to be the real issue here.

I think a lot of people are discounting your viewpoint because of your age, but even young children are aware that sometimes adults can be unfair and unable see it as unfair. I have had to explain many times to people that who someone is to them, isn't necessarily who that person is to someone else, many children have very different upbringings from the same parent(s).

That said, you are 15, you are in a time that is fair tumultuous at the best of times, and you still have much experience to come. So you may one day look back and think very differently with the benefit of experience.

Now it is fair to say that your sister getting to go with friends many times whereas you've only gone the once, is not your mother's fault, and your objections about your mother planning to take your sister aren't really reasonable in that respect. You don't say if you will be going with them or if either of your parents have offered an alternative activity for you though. It would be fair if you are not invited nor have been offered another activity to ask, perhaps you could spend the time with a friend or family member doing your own activity?

That said, you say that your sister gets more things, it could be that she might need something you don't, ie if she needs new socks and you don't it's reasonable not to buy new socks for you as well, it could also be that perhaps your mom isn't actually realising she spends more on your sister. Sometimes fair isn't necessarily equal, and it's possible to give everyone equal things and still be unfair because you aren't actually giving what they need as individuals.

We obviously don't know all the details here. So it's hard to give advice, but your feelings are your feelings. You're NTA for expressing that you feel less considered, though there are ways to say things that are more diplomatic than others.

It might be worth letting it cool down then sitting mom down, asking her to listen to your feelings and explaining why you feel that there is a difference in treatment and how that makes you feel.",-2,0,,,NTA,

Calling them out IMMEDIATELY triggers their pride and they become defensive. At best, if you feel like your mom is a somewhat reasonable adult, you could log in a journal for a few months all the instances of her playing favorites and then ask to have a calm & mature conversation with her 1 on 1 or you with both parents (probably best that a third party like your dad is around honestly). It shows you're serious while the journal helps deal with poor/biased memory recall from your mom. If after that conversation your mom did nothing but find excuses, get angry, get defensive and your dad took your mom's side, it's a lost cause. Focus on yourself, get your validation from friends, teachers and other adults and more importantly learn to objectively value yourself. You'll feel a lot better.

Post,1gr5odq,AITA for expecting my boyfriend to do all the chores while I work 2 jobs and go to school full-time?,peachyworlds,2024-11-14 14:14:13,"My boyfriend and I are in our 20s and we’ve been living together for a couple years now, we have a really good relationship and communicate well, I think this is just a matter of we both have a lot on our plates but any input is welcome.

I’m currently working 2 jobs, 5 days a week. I’m also a full-time student, so my other 2 days are taken up with being at school for 10-12 hours. I’m in my senior year of my degree as well so it’s a heavy course load and I’m also applying to grad school and internships at the moment. All 7 days of my week are occupied with either work or school, and I have to wake up between 5-7 am everyday. I’m barely home, but when I am home it’s spent doing homework, eating, and sleeping.

My boyfriend finished his degree a couple years ago and he is working full time, 4 days a week. Outside of that, he goes to the gym about 5 days a week, every Friday night he goes bowling with his friends, and a couple days a week he plays a card game with his friends.

At the start of the semester, we agreed that he would take on most of the chores, but I would help when I can and I’d still help with dinner because I enjoy cooking. He sometimes complains about having to do the chores and will ask me to help out with things here and there such as cleaning the cat’s litter, and I’ll do it. We both hate cleaning honestly so I get it’s annoying, but I’m starting to feel frustrated when he expects me to help with more chores.

In my eyes, we agreed on this beforehand and he was completely okay with supporting me. He also has 3 days a week that he gets to sleep in and he’s able to go the gym and have hobbies. I’ve been stressed because I don’t even have the time or mental capacity to make doctors appts that I need, and I had to stop going to the gym a couple months back. I don’t have the luxury of having time for myself, not to mention my body is physically sore as both my jobs also require me being on my feet all day.

AITA for getting frustrated that he expects me to help with housework too or am I putting too much on his plate? Does this sound balanced/fair? 


Update: Thank you for both perspectives I needed it!
To answer some questions:

-We split the bills evenly, I also have car payments hence why I needed a second job to help cover it. One of my jobs is also relevant to my field and I need it for my resume.

-My schedule is my choice to an extent, I’m going into a career in healthcare and the current school load is required, I don’t have any flexibility there.

-I work 40-45 hrs a week, he works 40.

-As someone said, we both see it as him supporting me towards my goals, and ultimately we want a life together, it was an agreement for our future.

-We do errands together, I still help with dishes and laundry regularly. I’m cleaning the floors this weekend and he asked for help cleaning the bathrooms as well.

I'd say I worked more than 45 hours/week. Luckily, I still lived at home so my chores were minimal and I had a paid-off car. It was still tough. But there is nothing to do but get through it.

Can you reduce your working hours a little? Your schedule is not sustainable for very long and it sounds like you're starting to resent that your boyfriend has free time. Resentment is very bad for a relationship. Or would he be able to shoulder a little more of the bills temporarily so you can maybe take a couple days off to catch up?

Y'all need to sit down and figure out who does what chores. It may be more than he was expecting when he agreed to do more of them. He may also be annoyed by having to ask you--that's a pretty common theme. Like, it's really frustrating when you have to ask someone to take the trash out when they, too, have working eyes and can see that it's full. I get that you're running yourself ragged but it takes <5 minutes to scoop out a litter box or wipe down a counter. I hate cleaning too, so I try to do a few minutes here and there throughout the day and it helps a lot IMO.

If it's less than a third, I'd say you're in the wrong.  If it's more than a third, I'd have to come down on you both being in the wrong, everyone sucks, and you need to have a bigger discussion.

You have a pre-existing agreement that he would take on most of the household chores, but most is not all, and helping when you can is not the same as helping when you feel like it.  Leaving all of the household chores on him is not a valid choice either.  Chores suck, and being left to do them all yourself because of your partner's choices is a dissatisfying grind.

You're over-extended because you have over-extended yourself.  Two jobs and full-time school is a choice, and you have to right to make that choice, but you don't have much right to complain about it.  Your boyfriend has days to sleep in and go to the gym and engage with hobbies because he has reached that point in his life.  Yes, in a caring relationship, he should be putting in effort to help you reach your goals, but that doesn't mean being your full-time housekeeper and half of your shared bills.

So, the question comes down to one of ratios: what fraction of chores are you being asked/expected to do out of the total amount of chore hours at home?  Are your bills equally split?

You frame it as you working two jobs and in schools to his one job, but your TWO jobs equal close the same amount as hours as his ONE job. 

So yes, you are in school and work a few more hours a week than he does, and he also agreed to pick up more of the slack at home. He agreed to do MOST of the chores, not all of them, and it seems you are annoyed at him asking you to do ANYTHING at all. He should absolutely be able to ask you to do things like help clean out the litter box, clean the floors periodically, etc. You said you would ""help where you can"" and he is asking you for that help, but is seems you think you shouldn't do anything besides cooking because you like it. 

That is what makes you an AH, because you agreed to him doing ""most"" and you ""would help where you can"" but have turned that in to being annoyed that he has held you to that. 

If you are rarely home, then he should mostly be cleaning up after himself (picking up items, taking out trash, wiping down dirty counters), and then taking on more of the home chores that happen regardless of who is/isn't home (bathrooms and floors might not get as dirty with you being gone, but they still do get dusty and even if you come home just to eat and sleep, you create dirt in those areas). Then there is stuff you create together as partners, like having pets, and they create mess/chores, and there is the chores you create, like laundry, that need to be done regardless of how much you are home. You need to sit down and create a better path forward on what he can take on and what you are willing to do, and it can't be 100% him, 0% you, because that is remarkably unfair.

I don’t think it’s unreasonable for him to ask for help with chores every now and then if he’s doing the bulk of them and you agreed to that.   It would be a different story if he was trying to absolve himself from them altogether. Cleaning the cat litter is a small chore -it doesn’t sound like he’s asking you to vacuum the house or clean the bathroom (which are “bigger” chores that I assume he is doing). Sometimes being the one to manage a house whilst also working full time can be really shit. I don’t think it’s fair to get frustrated if the person who is managing the house asks for what seems to be a relatively small bit of input. If you don’t feel you should be doing literally any chores in the house whatsoever, you should probably hire a cleaner. Expecting your SO to do absolutely everything while they are also working and then complaining about doing a few small chores seems a bit much to me.",39,0,,,YTA,

It sounds like he's taking on ""most"" of the chores.  Based on the way your post is written, it sounds like he's maybe doing 60-70%, you are doing 30-40%.  

Most is an ambigious term;  however, out of curiosity, I asked chatgpt.

> When someone says they'll do ""most"" of something, a reasonable percentage to assume is typically between 60% and 80%. This range acknowledges a majority share without implying completion or a near-total amount. Of course, the exact percentage can vary depending on context, but generally, ""most"" would mean over half and closer to three-quarters.

My boyfriend and I are in our 20s and we’ve been living together for a couple years now, we have a really good relationship and communicate well, I think this is just a matter of we both have a lot on our plates but any input is welcome.

I’m currently working 2 jobs, 5 days a week. I’m also a full-time student, so my other 2 days are taken up with being at school for 10-12 hours. I’m in my senior year of my degree as well so it’s a heavy course load and I’m also applying to grad school and internships at the moment. All 7 days of my week are occupied with either work or school, and I have to wake up between 5-7 am everyday. I’m barely home, but when I am home it’s spent doing homework, eating, and sleeping.

My boyfriend finished his degree a couple years ago and he is working full time, 4 days a week. Outside of that, he goes to the gym about 5 days a week, every Friday night he goes bowling with his friends, and a couple days a week he plays a card game with his friends.

At the start of the semester, we agreed that he would take on most of the chores, but I would help when I can and I’d still help with dinner because I enjoy cooking. He sometimes complains about having to do the chores and will ask me to help out with things here and there such as cleaning the cat’s litter, and I’ll do it. We both hate cleaning honestly so I get it’s annoying, but I’m starting to feel frustrated when he expects me to help with more chores.

In my eyes, we agreed on this beforehand and he was completely okay with supporting me. He also has 3 days a week that he gets to sleep in and he’s able to go the gym and have hobbies. I’ve been stressed because I don’t even have the time or mental capacity to make doctors appts that I need, and I had to stop going to the gym a couple months back. I don’t have the luxury of having time for myself, not to mention my body is physically sore as both my jobs also require me being on my feet all day.

AITA for getting frustrated that he expects me to help with housework too or am I putting too much on his plate? Does this sound balanced/fair?

I have a couple good friends, one of them I'll mention as Sophia (27F). We have been good friends for a while now since we shared a dorm in college. She's always been a bit annoying though. She always tries to make herself seem better than everyone else. I always thought I was the only one who saw this in her and never directly told anyone about it. There have been past situations that make me feel this way, but I digress.

On the day of the wedding I was, of course, super stressed. We had a problem with our catering service. Thankfully we got it all sorted out. After the ceremony I went to go see Sophia and some other friends. I was shocked when I saw her wearing a white dress. Yes, it did have some flowers on it, but still! It was enough white to be too much. I was pissed. I quickly pulled her to the side and told her to get the hell out. A couple days before the wedding she also was talking about how me and my now husband shouldn't be together. (she said this to one of our other friends, who told me). I knew it was a bad idea having her here but I didn't think she would wear white. She eventually left and my husband was telling me that I overreacted. 

Now I'm contemplating everything. I feel like I did overreact a bit but I feel what I did was right. She was being selfish and wanted to outshine me. Do I want her back as my friend? No. I feel like I also kicked her out in a good way, I didn't scream at her or make a big scene. But I don't know, maybe it was just the previous events or stress that made me feel this way.

Her wearing a white dress to your wedding was the proverbial last straw that broke the camel's back. Things had been on a low simmer for quite some time and the pot finally boiled over.

She definitely shouldn't be wearing anything white to a wedding and shouldn't be trashing your partner, assuming it was a bad faith comment and not a genuine criticism/concern. 

That said, a lot of this just isn't adding up to me. She's your best friend and a ""good friend"" but also she's ""always been annoying"" and now you're completely happy to cut her out of your life?? Also, to be frank, wearing white at a wedding is rude, but it's not ""you're clearly showing me up and deserve to be told to get the hell out"" level of rude.

Deciding to cut contact or not being friends with her is one thing, but kicking her out was probably a bit much",20,0,,,ESH,

They suck for wearing white, but it's not really ""trying to outshine you"". There is clearly some long-standing personal issues here. You call them a ""good friend"" but then imply that you don't like them and that they are annoying? 

> She's always been a bit annoying though. She always tries to make herself seem better than everyone else.

It sounds like you see her as competing with you, does it feels a bit like you may have invited her to the wedding to try and rub her nose in the fact you were getting married?

> I knew it was a bad idea having her here

If you don't like someone then I don't see why you would invite them to your wedding.

At the end of the day, if your wedding is ruined because of what someone else is wearing, to the point you have to yell at them to ""get the hell out"", then something else is smelling rotten there.

In my mother's family,  I had never heard of not wearing white to a wedding up until about 5 years ago. Then it still wasn't in my mother's family. Once at 11 and once at 17 I wore white. At 11 it was a slightly more formal dress but still not wedding dress style. At 17, my mother made it, it had flowers on it and there's no way you call it a formal dress. It was plain cotton and nothing at all fancy. My mother's family didn't give a damn what color was worn because only the bridal party wore formal attire. Same with my wedding and the few weddings I went to while married. Nothing was ever said about the color but they were all very obviously not formal dresses. At best, they were dresses you wear to a normal church service. That was also 20+ years ago. I don't know about the weddings where more formal clothing were worn, that could be a completely different story. But it's obvious that for quite a while now, more weddings are on the formal attire side and in which case, along with the widely accepted wedding etiquette, now it's very inappropriate! Since it's now considered wedding etiquette, even my dress at 17 would be inappropriate outside of my mother's family and my wedding. I honestly didn't give a damn what people wore as long as they did wear literally ragged jeans and such. And now I wouldn't even consider such a dress since nobody seems to want anyone else wearing white. I went to a lot of weddings,  but that's only because my mother had 12 other siblings and she was second oldest. I have went to less than 5 outside of my mother's family.",2,0,,,,

I (27F) just got married a couple days ago. I have a couple good friends, one of them I'll mention as Sophia (27F). We have been good friends for a while now since we shared a dorm in college. She's always been a bit annoying though. She always tries to make herself seem better than everyone else. I always thought I was the only one who saw this in her and never directly told anyone about it. There have been past situations that make me feel this way, but I digress.

On the day of the wedding I was, of course, super stressed. We had a problem with our catering service. Thankfully we got it all sorted out. After the ceremony I went to go see Sophia and some other friends. I was shocked when I saw her wearing a white dress. Yes, it did have some flowers on it, but still! It was enough white to be too much. I was pissed. I quickly pulled her to the side and told her to get the hell out. A couple days before the wedding she also was talking about how me and my now husband shouldn't be together. (she said this to one of our other friends, who told me). I knew it was a bad idea having her here but I didn't think she would wear white. She eventually left and my husband was telling me that I overreacted. 

Now I'm contemplating everything. I feel like I did overreact a bit but I feel what I did was right. She was being selfish and wanted to outshine me. Do I want her back as my friend? No. I feel like I also kicked her out in a good way, I didn't scream at her or make a big scene. But I don't know, maybe it was just the previous events or stress that made me feel this way. Isn't it proper etiquette to not wear white to a wedding? Literally why are you trying to outshine me? Which I know, it's crazy, ""why outshine me"" but it's ME and MY HUSBAND'S big day! NOT YOURS!

Post,1gr10pe,AITA for telling my friend she can get back in touch when she stops being perpetually busy?,Anteatereatingant,2024-11-14 09:22:30,"So, long story short: I've had it with one of my friends. We've known each other for about 12 years (met at uni, now we're mid-30s). She's the ""permanently busy"" type - if you know, you know. Always doing something, can't be alone with her thoughts for one second, hyper-extroverted, etc.

She's a nice person but that pattern of compulsive ""busy-ness"" got on my nerves from the start. Like...after we graduated she worked part-time. That's it. For extra money she let out the other three bedrooms in her house. No kids, no dogs, no serious partners, no ailing relatives. And despite working maximum 2-3 days a week from 8 to 3, she was almost impossible to get a hold of. I lived 30 minutes away ON FOOT and we'd still see each other every 3-4 months at best. And every time, the spiel was ""I know it's been ages but I'm just so *BUSY!*"".

A few years ago I moved so we're now in different countries. I tried to stay in touch via WhatsApp but even that's been falling apart. Over the lockdown she got married and had two kids. So you can imagine how hard she is to get a hold of now that she actually has responsibilities and isn't just busy being busy.

So for the past year now our interactions have dwindled down to me sending her life updates and asking about hers...and her getting back weeks later if I'm lucky, months later or not at all if I'm not, with a generic *""so sorry, been so busy but you're in my thoughts, how are you x""*. Meanwhile she's still pretty active on social media and regularly posting about all the fun things she gets up to with all those other people.

**So** to cut a long story short, I decided this means she's just not interested and trying to tell me nicely. I mean...how else *am* I supposed to take barely answering me, and if so mostly just to remind me for the millionth time of *just how BUSY* she is, while simultaneously showing off all the things and people she \*does\* miraculously find the time for?

**Now here's the kicker.** She messaged me about three months after my last message, once again with a generic *""so sorry, so busy, how are u xx*"". And I chose not to respond because I'm over it. A month later (last week) it was my birthday, and she sent a birthday message and sounded quite upset I hadn't responded to the previous one.

I responded by telling her what I said in the title: ""What's the point of messaging you anyway, when I already know how it's gonna go? I'll pass. Let me know if you ever get less permanently busy and can keep in touch on a more substantial level than getting back to me months later just to remind me of how busy you are"".

I heard through the grapevine (mutual friends/acquaintances) that she's upset at how I talked to her. But I don't think I'm in the wrong here. Am I obligated to keep making an effort for someone who just can't or won't reciprocate? *And FFS - isn't it bizarre to get upset when someone you clearly don't care enough about to make an effort to include in your life, lets go?*

**So the main things I took away,** were

1. I should address issues like that more head-on and earlier, before they fester into a whole ugly feelings-bomb.
2. I did, in fact, feel some contempt (for her constant talking of how busy she is, when most of it was self-selected; it felt like a martyr act) and envy (for how I was constantly prioritized below other things),  pain (for being called 'friend' while not being given what I would consider the friend treatment, like space in someone's life) and resentment (for feeling like I'm being treated like an idiot who somehow can't tell ""I'm sooo busy!"" followed by 17 Tiktoks is just code for ""I'm not that bothered"").
3. A friendship that has any significant of contempt, resentment, envy, anger, or any other negative feeling is not the look when you're in your 30s.
4. I am still pretty harsh even when (in my perception) I'm pulling my punches. And if so many other people see that, I guess it's more likely that I really do have more aggression than I think, than that they all are overreacting.
5. Many people on Reddit can't read 😂 There were a lot of insightful comments and questions that made me think hard about myself...but there were also plenty that completely missed the point and/or put words in my mouth.

Thank you all!

The friendship has changed and it's clear you two have different priorities. It sounds like you don't understand her motivations for keeping busy and she doesn't sound like she's particularly good at carving out quality time for you.

I cut off a more than decade long friendship for something similar. She had moved to another state, barely kept in contact but when we talked only complained about how much she misses home, I got a place that she could move into, she refused. 

Years go by, she reaches out to hang out. Turns out she had moved back months prior and was only reaching out because her boyfriend was having a party with all his friends and she had none (wonder why). 

Ended up being excuse after excuse when I would try to hang out, I eventually cussed her out and called it the end.

Granted, I own my own business,  so not exactly the same as 'just' working part-time. 

Some ppl need to see their friends every other day to remain 'friends', some ppl go IMA in months, but they're *there* when you really need them. 

I had situations the other way around. A good friend always wants to spend more time together,  but she mostly wants to meet up for stuff like 'home parties' where someone comes to your house to sell stuff, and you need to invite your friends. 
I told her I'm not really into that. I don't have much time as it is, and I would rather just meet up and take some time to catch up and have some wine. 
She took offence.

I fell out of touch with a long distance friend a couple of years back due to similar vibe I was getting - months with no replies, only to get back to me with a few lines responding to my update - happy for my new job, so sorry about my latest health issues, blah blah blah. No response at all to my asking how she's doing. Then a few months would go by with me waiting for her to reply (as she had promised), then I wrote to her again and months would go by again before she replied. Yet, when I messaged her with a very specific ask for information from her field of expertise, I got a detailed reply within a week, ""how are you? Miss you so much, talk to you soon!"" tackled at the end. I knew she was *genuinely* busy - PhD, health issues, family etc. - but she had made time for me at one point in her life and then just. Stopped. 

We met more than a decade ago online. Saw each other through most of the college, major heartbreaks, mental breakdowns, big health scares and issues etc., met in person at one point when she visited my country with her partner for a few days and had a blast. I miss her a lot, but I'm not going to keep begging for attention from someone who very clearly has a different set of priorities. So I just stopped writing to her. And she never wrote to me again either. 

And yes, all of my friendships changed when we finished college, we went from seeing each other daily to meeting a few times per month. But in my experience, people will make time for people they care about *enough*, one way or another. I make time for my friends despite having a full time job, being in a loving relationship, having two cats and a bunch of hobbies.

I have realized some people drown in a drop of water. Meaning that just because I can handle work, friendships, family etc and don't feel extremely busy some people's stress levels are much lower and they will feel super busy doing half the things I do. 
They feel overwhelmed with few things and it can sound a bit bizarre when they complain about it knowing how much you have on your plate and still make an effort to keep in touch. 

Also because you don't have a daily connection to each other it is very much likely that she doesn't prioritize responding to you. Between your message another 10 maybe comes in that she feels obliged to reply first and therefore yours is dismissed for a while. 
Now it all seems like she doesn't see you as a close friend in that sense but close enough to casually catch up with.

You are not the asshole for noticing it but maybe a bit bitter of the way of answering.
Since she has been like this for most of the time you could have just accepted that this is the way she is and the kind of friend she is.
Meaning you could also have placed her in your not so close friend circle. 
And catch up now and then and be fine with it. 
Instead you have been bothered by this and waited for the time to be able to say - ha, got you! And bite back....
But you bit back on something that to her was not even a problem really, she never realized what you were feeling hence also her reaction to your reply.

Comment,1gr10pe,AITA for telling my friend she can get back in touch when she stops being perpetually busy?,justlearningtoteach,2024-11-14 14:33:47,"Sooo I'm the perpetually busy friend, not OP's but in my circle.

I have ADHD.

The easiest excuse I can muster when I'm overwhelmed or just do not have enough brain space for interactions I use the I'm busy line.

I have friends that I don't text for ages, but because they all now understand they are fine.  I am only truly able to concentrate on what is within the space around me otherwise it gets too much.

A little like out of mind out of sight but not on purpose. I forget people literally exist until I either 
A. See them 
B. See something that reminds me of them C. Get a message from them or someone related which reminds me of them
D. When my calendar notifies me it is their birthday, partners birthday or children's birthday.

But to be honest sometimes I'll pick up my phone see like I have 40 notifications from people and immediately put my phone down cause now I'm overwhelmed because there's too many messages. Those that text often are likely to get a hold of me because they are always at the top of my message lists. If you don't text often then I likely won't scroll down far enough to see your message until I do a purge of my messages, or when my brain finally kicks in and I have enough mental capacity to go through all the messages and reply. But it's not just that, I also have time blindness sometimes so I don't even realise how long its been. 

With that explanation let me tell you a story.

I had a wonderful friend like a brother to me, we were almost inseparable when I was in Zimbabwe, he was always where I was and we always hung out. Then I came back to the UK and we would chat every 2/4 months, not for his lack of trying but because of the above, he would send one or two messages that would then get buried at the bottom of my messages until I did a purge or if he messaged on a day where there weren't many notifications or distractions I was able to respond.

Then he got diagnosed with cancer and died 2 months later, in the two month of me knowing of his diagnosis, I spoke to him 4 times and each time was separated by a couple of weeks. All due to the time blindness and either forgetting to check my phone or his message getting buried the distractions, cognitive overload etc 

I cared for this man, deeply I cried for a week when he died,  was inconsolable, guilt ridden because why tf couldn't I text him more, why can't my brain do it and I went into a cycle of depression or a few month, and it is absolutely horrid to not be able to keep up that communication. ADHD sucks it hurts not only the people who are on the receiving end of it, it also hurts the person with it too.


I'm not saying your friend has this OP but it is a sign, it's how I managed to get my diagnosis last year which only happened after my friend died and I was spurred to seek help. I am now 29.",3,0,,,,

I had a best friend we were bffs for 15-16 years. We kept our friendship even after my family moved overseas and originally the only way to communicate were letters, as in snail mail.

Post,1gqn0b1,WIBTA if I don‘t tell her that the chocolate contains sugar?,ProbablyAH,2024-11-13 20:42:33,"Update:
We talked yesterday and I told her that the chocolate contains sugar. She looked at me a little confused and said:“ Yes, I know? But I like it.“

So the misunderstanding came about like this:
She bought herself chocolate shavings without added white sugar and told me about it.
When she went shopping some weeks later she saw her favorite ones (dark chocolate) and decided that it was not worth the extra effort for her to get the other ones. She also told me, they don’t have the same crunch, so she decided to go with the „regular“ ones.

So thanks to those, that gave me the „extra nudge“. She smiled and told me I should‘ve told her directly. Have a great rest of the week. 

—————————————————————

Hello, 
my partner (f in her 30s) is quite into sport and not much into sweets.

She stopped eating ADDED sugar „completely“ about a year ago. 
She doesn’t have a medical constitution, but just realized, that she‘s doing way better without the sugar. 
She also doesn’t restrict my eating.
For example, when we went to a fancy cake place I wanted to go to, she also ate cake, but was feeling a little nauseous afterwards.
So she‘s not completely strict-strict, as sometimes she enjoys honey or if I bake something, e.g..

Now to my dilemma: every weekend she makes coffee for us and does a „special blend“. When she made it before she used cocoa powder, but changed to dark chocolate shavings. 
It‘s really really nice, but I realized some days ago that she doesn’t know that there is sugar in them.

She eats her yogurt topped with them and is beaming with joy, when telling me „they don’t contain sugar“. 
They do, she just had the wrong column when checking them.

I really love seeing her happy and I researched before and the chocolate shavings without sugar are 1. expensive and 2. I‘m actually not able to eat them (due to intolerance). 
I also really support her otherwise, when cooking, baking, etc. I check twice as not to include any sugar. 
(I also realize on the other hand that she‘s mostly checking for Glucose and doesn’t care about fructose.)

So WIBTA if I don‘t tell her that there‘s sugar in her new found joy? 

EDIT: to fix typos

2. EDIT: Thanks guys. I think I just needed a nudge to make the right decision. I‘m at her place tomorrow and will talk to her. 

3. EDIT: To clarify: 

I put “added” in, as people were confused. Sorry, I thought it was obvious, that one’s on my part.

The yoghurt used in the example she‘s eating has no added sugar. 
Yes she knows that there are different types of sugar. 
As I mentioned before, it‘s about added Glucose. 
Yes she is capable of reading. 
No, she‘s not stupid, as the package has two different collums as it‘s baking chocolate and one type of them has no added sugar but sweetener. 
Yes, I know, that there are also Health risk when consuming too  much sweetener. 
It was a simple question guys.",2601,298,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gqn0b1/wibta_if_i_dont_tell_her_that_the_chocolate/,"The final verdict is: **Asshole**

Comment,1gqn0b1,WIBTA if I don‘t tell her that the chocolate contains sugar?,kharmatika,2024-11-13 20:52:39,"EDIT: Made a few tweaks to verbiage because I think my point is not getting across(Although OP completely understood what I meant and thought it was worth looking into just to be more aware of it for the future). This has blown up, so I want people to be able to use it as a reference and jumping off point for their own research.  
  
1. YWBTA. Lying to your partner for their ""Happiness"" isn't an option when their happiness is derived from something that has lasting effects on their health. 

2. I would suggest looking into a disorder called Orthorexia. It's an eating disorder centering around ""Right Eating"". Where anorexics obsess over weight and calories, Ortho's obsess over Toxins, or Sugar, or Glycemic Index or liver function. I know this because I have it(Also sugar avoidant, also have 0 medical reason to be such at this point but I get terrified that having a soda will cause me to die gasping like my mother). Your girlfriend sounds like she may have some food avoidance issues that bear further discussion, and it's worth both digging into the cause of those avoidances, and becoming constantly aware o how they are affecting her life, an her emotions. The fact that you're worried about your partners reaction going sour if she finds out she's eating her ""Villain Food"", is what concerns me the most. Ortho, and all eating disorders, are not about the food itself, but the emotions around it, and the restriction and control fallacies, so ensuring that the ongoing approach to this diet is done in a healthy, non-disordered way is important, because a healthy diet can easily become ortho without notice of the people around the person.   
  
If I'm completely off base, ignore me, but I want you to know about this illness because almost no one does and the symptoms can go from totally normal diet stuff to hospitalizable in a matter of months, and lots of people miss it because ""Well they aren't restricting calories or trying to lose weight!"" but a nutritional imbalance can kill with very little fanfare or outwards change. And because many ortho's, like me, are also bulimic, so ""Well she eats cake now and then, she wouldn't do that if she was obsessing"" isn't necessarily an accurate statement.",3932,0,,,YWBTA,

Post,1gqoohb,AITA for telling my mom's boyfriend he had a say in his PTSD ,TheGoodM1lk,2024-11-13 21:53:07,"I'm a disabled 21 year old woman and my mom's current boyfriend (m 46) doesn't believe i am. I struggle with a lot of mental health issues(child hood PTSD, major depression, anxity, ADHD and autim. all dignoised by a profesinal and i am in treatment for them all) from childhood trauma and have severe chronic migraines. But overall I seem like a “normal” person, and I think that's what he gets stuck on.

Every time I try to talk about problems to my mom, well he's around. It turns into a dick measuring competition of which one of us is more disabled. Personally I think that's a regressive mindset and puts more stigma on mental health by saying there's a magical bar you have to get to for your struggles to really matter. But clearly he thinks two different disabilities should be measured on a one to one scale and his disability is worse than mine. He states that he's disabled to but doesn't have nearly as much trouble as I do and his disability is worse than mine. His disability being ptsd from time as a marin.

He believes because he's really disabled (the government sends him money every month) And I'm not( because it's incredibly difficult to get disability for migraines) that he gets to tell me how to handle my disability and that i'm doing it poorly. Not only that he very much implies that I'm not just playing up my issues but faking them.

This all came to a head when I told him well he was on another of his tirades, That he got a say in his disability. Not only Is he a man and his issues are actually taken seriously by the medical industry, but he applied for the military knowing about ptsd. He got 18 years of normality before going into the military, and he knew he had a risk of developing ptsd when he went in. I however was born this way and had no control over my trauma as I was a child when it occurred.

Please don't get me wrong. I fully respect veterans and their need for treatment. They deserve respect and validation. I was just tired of him telling me I wasn't disabled and had no excuse for not being a fully functional member of society because even if I was disabled he can function just fine.

I have never before played down his ptsd (and I don't think pointing out he had an idea that going into the military could and likely would result in ptsd is me down playing it.) I normally don't even justify his comments about me with a real response. I just wanted to point out that it's not fair to compare our struggles on a one to one scale, and that i am just as deserving of understanding for my disabilities as he is. After 2 years of him degrading and belittling my issues.

Now he's trying to get my mom to kick me out because of how disrespectful I was to him. Even though this is the first time I have ever snapped back at him, well he's always going on and on and on about how I'm a failure of a human being.

He's been, intentionally or not, trying to pick a fight with you about this for a while.

Trauma is trauma, and that shouldn't be a contest, much less one someone wants to win.

That paired with him immediately jumping to kicking you out for your response makes me wonder if that is really a partial goal of it all to begin with - getting an excuse to give to your mom so he can have the house be just him and your mom?

Every time I try to talk about problems to my mom, well he's around. It turns into a dick measuring competition of which one of us is more disabled. Personally I think that's a regressive mindset and puts more stigma on mental health by saying there's a magical bar you have to get to for your struggles to really matter. But clearly he thinks two different disabilities should be measured on a one to one scale and his disability is worse than mine. He states that he's disabled to but doesn't have nearly as much trouble as I do and his disability is worse than mine. His disability being ptsd from time as a marin.

He believes because he's really disabled (the government sends him money every month) And I'm not( because it's incredibly difficult to get disability for migraines) that he gets to tell me how to handle my disability and that i'm doing it poorly. Not only that he very much implies that I'm not just playing up my issues but faking them.

This all came to a head when I told him well he was on another of his tirades, That he got a say in his disability. Not only Is he a man and his issues are actually taken seriously by the medical industry, but he applied for the military knowing about ptsd. He got 18 years of normality before going into the military, and he knew he had a risk of developing ptsd when he went in. I however was born this way and had no control over my trauma as I was a child when it occurred.

Please don't get me wrong. I fully respect veterans and their need for treatment. They deserve respect and validation. I was just tired of him telling me I wasn't disabled and had no excuse for not being a fully functional member of society because even if I was disabled he can function just fine.

I have never before played down his ptsd (and I don't think pointing out he had an idea that going into the military could and likely would result in ptsd is me down playing it.) I normally don't even justify his comments about me with a real response. I just wanted to point out that it's not fair to compare our struggles on a one to one scale, and that i am just as deserving of understanding for my disabilities as he is. After 2 years of him degrading and belittling my issues.

Now he's trying to get my mom to kick me out because of how disrespectful I was to him. Even though this is the first time I have ever snapped back at him, well he's always going on and on and on about how I'm a failure of a human being.

Post,1gq4pte,AITA for putting the kibosh on Sons' naked vacation?,DadKnowzBest,2024-11-13 04:24:50,"I have boys 18 and 19, who will be completing their freshman and sophomore college years in the spring. They are doing great in school, excellent grades despite both being on athletic teams and extra curriculars that are a time suck. I'm very proud Dad for how they are doing.

As a reward for doing so well I have told them I'd pay their way for a vacation during their spring break in a few months, anywhere that they'd like to go (well, within reason. If either picked Antarctica we'd have to talk about that).

The boys wanted to go to an all-inclusive resort in Jamaica, apparently a whole bunch of their friends from school have the same idea and want a big fun group trip.

I was all for that, and all for Jamaica. That sounds like fun (I've been to Jamaica years ago and had a great time). However a combination of overhearing some details and seeing some info has me a bit unsettled.

They have plans to go to a resort called -- get this -- **Hedonism**. I looked it up (maybe that was my mistake). Hedonism is apparently pretty raunchy, *very* ""adult,"" and is pretty much the Caribbean's answer to Hefner's Playboy Mansion. It's got just about everything you'd want in a resort as far as activities and such, but just about the whole place is ""clothing optional"" and some of the places like one of the beaches and a couple of the pools are actually REQUIRED nude. And they have things like ""playrooms"" and ""happening huts"" and one can only imagine what goes on there. There's theme nights like ""naughty nurses"" and ""fetish leather and lingerie.""

I gave that the hard ""nope."" I want to reward them, but I'm not about to fund what sound like nothing short of an orgy. They were NOT impressed with my decision, not in the least.

So am I an asshole for backing out of funding the vacation I promised?

P.S. I am *not* a prude. Far from it. I know they have sex. They are gorgeous popular athletic boys on a college campus, I'm not that dumb. They're probably having a **lot** of it. I'm fine with that, encouraging even. I bought them both condoms starting when they were 16. I **want** them to have fun, I **want** them to get busy as long as they are smart and safe and respectful, and make great college memories. I just don't want to pay for a nude-a-rama at the Caribbean fuck-a-torium on my dime.

Comment,1gq4pte,AITA for putting the kibosh on Sons' naked vacation?,Fast-Chipmunk-1558,2024-11-13 09:19:14,"As the only person who has actually been to Hedonism I will say you are not the AH, if you're spending the money. But I would not dictate where 18 year olds go once they are spending their money. 

To correct the assumption that Hedonism is a big swingers orgy, it's not . It's a clothing optional resort first and foremost that attracts nudists first, and people in the lifestyle second . Single/solo guys are rare at Hedo, it's mostly couples, some solo women and few solo men.

The average age of the crowd varies depending on which groups are there, I would say when I went average age was 30 to 40, there were less ""unfit"" bodies. I would say most people were average and attractive, few were extremely fit/supermodel status and few were ""hairy and overweight"". 

It could be that when your sons are planning on going that they are organizing groups of that age group so the majority would be people their age . It wouldn't matter what other groups are there as they could socialize mainly with their groups .

I met a gorgeous couple on honeymoon and another couple from Jamaica that were above average in looks and body. The nude pool/nude beach is where you would see more open sexual activity but I saw full blown sex on the "" prude"" clothing optional sex. 

There is a playroom for couple or group sex  that I never saw because swinging is not my thing, I just went for the novelty of being nude. 

I wasn't hit on by swinger's, as in they didn't openly solicit me for sex, I would just get compliments, there is no pressure to do anything or join in anything. I went solo and was adopted by several groups and they made sure I was having fun, had people to hang out with if I wanted and escorted me to my room at night so I would feel safe . 

I would be more worried about the availability of drugs from the guys selling on the beach than swingers recruiting anyone to join their orgy ( didn't see any happening in public).

A group of young people at Hedo would definitely have a good time 😃",200,0,,,,

Look, a 18 and 19 year old can *talk* themselves up to a lot of shit, but I know you remember what it was like to be that age and actually have to follow through. You know as well as I do that all that's going to happen is that they hide in the room for a week, too terrified to walk around a bunch of naked old people.

""I want my hot kids to have lots and lots of sex just not at a place intended for sex. I'm sex positive but that makes me feel icky."" I mean, okay, it's your money - and we all have our lines. Even if you don't see yourself as a ""prude,"" clearly you still have your hangups; there's just some real cognitive dissonance here between how you see yourself and the various concerns you're expressing.

Get your head out of the sand - if your two ""gorgeous popular athletic"" sons are going somewhere for spring break, it's likely to be a Caribbean fuck-a-thon on your dime regardless. Pay for an airbnb? Hey, a private fuck-a-torium. Hotel? They won't be naked by the pool, but the rest is on the table. If they're going on this trip with the intent to have sex, they're gonna do it.

And ironically, often those spaces are both sex positive *and* responsible, especially for things like encouraging safe sex practices and enforcing consent. Those sex rooms almost always have things like condoms readily available, and the slightest whiff of boundary crossing is a quick trip out the door. So I think it's worth doing a little self-reflection of why you're hung up on this. Why do you think *this* place is so bad? What is the message your reticence sending about sex?

they are boys going away on spring break, with the very likely intention of getting blasted and having lots of sex and seeing boobs out in the open wherever they go.

Hedo (I’ve been a few times now) will probably be the safest place for them to do this, and like a lot of others have said, the majority of folks that go there are 35+.

We've been together since college. I grew up in a pescetarian household, and have maintained those eating habits for myself as an adult. My husband was brought up eating meat, but told me he's always had qualms about it himself, and 'tested out' being vegetarian for some time when we was a young adult. Even though he was not a pescetarian when he and I started dating (at 20) he is now fully pescetarian (and even stronger in his conviction than me!). It's been 5 or so years that he is fully pescetarian.

His family (extended and immediate) knows this, and we've spent many family meals/holidays together. What irks me is that every time we are at his parents, they still offer him meat, and act surprised when he doesn't have any. He's explained to them ""I don't eat meat anymore"" multiple times, but it keeps re-occuring. His parents are very young so I doubt this is a memory issue. It feels like they are trying to undermine his choice, and they seem to hold this against me, despite the fact that I never forced/force him to do this!

His mother will often makes comment ""oh so you *really* don't eat any meat anymore?"" His parents have no issues accomodating their nieces / nephews who are severely picky eaters, but they routinely don't prepare anything pescetarian (so we end up eating what we've brought if we've brought a side or dish) and then his parents will say ""Oh we're sorry, we didn't realize you wouldn't eat any of the food!""

Maybe I'm in my head a bit about it but it feels intentional. I don't mind bringing our own food when we go, but everyone obviously takes from what we bring, and we end up with almost no options. I don't expect them to change their cooking habits for us, but the comments seem unecessary

I have a couple of issues with your post. The first is. Your husband is able to speak to his family, if he chooses to do so. There is no reason for you to intervene on his behalf. He is obviously capable of telling his parents that he is sure that he doesn't eat meat, when the subject is brought up.

I am a pescatarian. It's my choice. Any ""dietary restrictions"" are of my choosing. I don't expect my carnivore family to accommodate me by purchasing, and preparing fish, when that is not what everyone is eating. 

Pescaterians eat a mainly plant based diet, that includes fish. It doesn't demand it. There is food to eat at family functions. There have been occasions where I have brought a protien for myself, and enjoyed eating other things, on the table, with my family, for dinner. There have been times where I've eaten beforehand, allowing myself to choose the things that I want, when I sit at a table with my family.

You mentioned that your in-laws accommodate you. So you already know how to eat with carnivores. Your issue appears to be that you feel that you that that your in-laws haven't accepted your husband's decision.

I don't feel that it is your responsibility, or your place, to brooch the topic with them. It's his. If he wants to do so.

When I first met my husband I'd been vegetarian for several years. He started eating veggie with me, but would also eat meat when he was out or offered meat elsewhere divorced parents knew how to deal with a vegetarian. 

His mom would go to the grocery store and pick up everything in the vegetarian aisle. The first time we were over for a meal she threw her hands up and said ""I had no idea what vegetarians eat. So I went to the store and got everything I could. I hope there's something you like."" She had no idea what to do, but she did the best she could with her whole heart. I loved her for it. 

His dad and stepmom made an elaborate vegetarian dish. The first time that I met them. I thought it seemed like a lot of work, and over the top, but I was very appreciative. The next time I went they literally had forgotten to think about me. They offered me a baked potato for dinner. And every single time we'd visit them, they would consistently offer little bits of meat here and there. ""Oh, we didn't realize you don't eat (insert ham, bacon, shrimp,... here)"" No matter how many times we explained what vegetarian meant, they would/could not wrap their heads around it.

The irony was a couple of decades later, when Dad went vegetarian for health reasons. All of a sudden, he's extolling the virtues of a vegetarian diet and telling us all about vegetarian foods as though we'd never heard of these things. It still makes me laugh. 

I get the feeling that your husband's family is more like my husband's father. It doesn't matter how many times you explain to them, they don't want to understand.

Post,1gpmt6i,AITA? Woman threatens to call police on me for asking questions in the laundry room,Neat-Motor4294,2024-11-12 15:07:49,"So I live in Finland at a student apartment complex. I had done some laundry the day before, and was going to pick them up from the drying room. There was this older woman doing her laundry. What caught my eye was that she had a green water hose going from the laundry room's seperate water tap into the laundry machine's hatch/hole where you put the detergents.

I had not seen that kind of water hose setup before, so I was curious. I asked about it, and if the water pipes that normally supply the water to the machine had gone dry. She said in pretty good Finnish that she didn't understand the question. I presume she didn't know the word for water hose (*vesiletku*), so I repeated the question, this time pointing to the hose and pipes. She asked if I spoke any Russian. I didn't, but I had access to Google Translate.

As I was writing, she told me to ""stop bullying her"", which I first took as humorous banter between neighbours. I showed her the translation, but she *refused* to look at it, again repeating that I should stop bullying her, and that I should back off. Confused, I asked what she meant, but she took her own phone, began filming me, and said that if I would not stop ""bullying"" her she would send the video to the police (!?).

As she refused to even listen to my explanations, I stopped trying. I still had my dry laundry in the adjacent drying room, so what followed was kind of awkward 5 minutes as I folded my clothes up and she kept sitting on the laundry room bench. The threat to call the cops on me seemed very uncalled for, so I wanted to try one more time to set the record straigth. So I wrote a little ""sorry about that, I was just curious about the hose"" paragraph to explain and de-escalate the situation. She again refused to look at my phone, and said very rudely that she didn't want to talk to me nor see me. 

All our communication was in Finnish, as she refused to look at my attempted Russian translations.

Idk if I did anything wrong, but here are my theories to what might have gone wrong on my part:

* She said that she had reserved the laundry room, and took my presence as barging in. (However, the reservations are for the laundry machines, and I was picking up my dried up laundry. I had every right to be there)
* She took my (20-ish male) casual talking to her (35-45 yr woman) as some sort of sexual harrasment?
* She took my male presence as threatening? When I brought my phone closer to her face that she could read the translations, that's when she told me to back off. However, I was keeping the polite-distance-with-strangers the whole time.
* Russo-Finnish mistranslation? Although she spoke Finnish very well, she clearly didn't know some words.
* Cultural difference in something?

I had acted calm and casual (though increasingly confused) during the whole situation, but thought it was both very unwarranted and rude as fuck by the woman to begin filming me and threatening to call the cops on me. But maybe I missed something in the situation?

2. I might be the asshole for coming our of nowhere to ask a stranger questions about their laundry machine setup. Maybe because I kept trying to talk to them, even thought they had told me to stop

You asked a reasonable question as the hose thing sounds very odd.  I would report her to the buildings management as it could be what she is doing to the machine could damage it if its not meant to work that way.  

She did seem to go from 0 to 100 in an instant.  I expect she did know full well what *vesiletku* means and was worried she was going to get in trouble if she was doing something wrong so went on the offensive.

Narrator:  OP didn't stop trying.

Are you on the spectrum or something?

You seem to be constantly questioning human interactions and mis reading social cues and backtracking/backforthing as you continually question yourself on the situation and how to act.

You seem to have a very poor read on what is clearly someone that wants to be left alone on first interaction.

>As I was writing, she told me to ""stop bullying her"" [clear indication], which I first took as humorous banter between neighbours.[very bad interpretation by you] I showed her the translation, but she refused to look at it, again repeating that I should stop bullying her, and that I should back off.

I’ll take your word that you meant well and were genuinely curious. However, I think you missed multiple cues that this woman wanted to be left alone.

“I don’t understand the question.” When someone says this in the language of the question it often is someone gently trying to stop a conversation. However, tone and facial expressions matter here, along with cultural expectations. Trying to clarify wouldn’t be inappropriate.

“Do you speak Russian?” This could be a genuine attempt to communicate. It could also be an attempt to more quickly and fluently ask you to stop.

At this point most people would decide that a conversation based around a minor curiosity isn’t worth the effort and would stop. Most people would believe someone actively trying to continue must feel strongly about what they are trying to say. The other option is that the person trying engage conversation must feel strongly that the other person must give them their attention.

“She told me to stop bullying her which I took as humorous banter.” Why? Why would you assume the older female stranger who is alone in an enclosed space with a twenty something man would “joke” about being bullied? Even if you did think it was a joke, why would you encourage that when the consequences of others not understanding the “joke” could affect your life? 

“I showed her the translation but she refused to look at it and said repeated that I should stop.” Then stop and apologize profusely for the misunderstanding. Don’t be mad the woman who already asked you to stop got further upset because instead of stoping you got closer to show her your phone. 

It’s crystal clear at this point the women didn’t want to speak to you. Report to the building if you think the hose was illegal, do some research back in your room if you’re genuinely curious about the hose, but this point is the point where most people end this interaction.

“Confused, I asked what she meant.” What was so confusing about stop? Even if the interaction confused you, why was it so important to keep pushing this woman into conversation?

“She took her phone and began filming me and said she would take the video to the police.” She probably didn’t know how to or couldn’t live stream or FaceTime someone, but this is absolutely the right call for anyone to make when someone is still trying engage with you after being repeatedly told to stop.

“After she refused to listen to my explanations I stopped trying.” Was your explanation that you were extremely sorry for frightening her and would stop?

“I wanted to try one more time to set the record straight” Because the way you thought she saw you was making *you* uncomfortable, therefore you were willing to risk making her more uncomfortable if it potentially meant making *you* feel better. 

“I wrote a paragraph to explain the situation.” Again, why? Why does it matter? Why did you think it mattered more than her very clear message to be left alone?

“She again refused to look at my phone and said very rudely that she didn’t want to talk to me.” There is nothing rude about her being frustrated that you continued to ignore her wishes. She did not want to talk to you. She told you multiple times to the point where she started filming you to get you to stop. And *she’s* the rude one?


I understand that things escalated quickly. I’m not arguing whether that escalation was justified or not justified. However, while I understand your initial attempt to continue the conversation I don’t understand why you didn’t stop once it was very very clear she wanted you to stop.

All this because you were curious about a hose? Was it really worth it?

So I live in Finland at a student apartment complex. I had done some laundry the day before, and was going to pick them up from the drying room. There was this older woman doing her laundry. What caught my eye was that she had a green water hose going from the laundry room's seperate water tap into the laundry machine's hatch/hole where you put the detergents.

I had not seen that kind of water hose setup before, so I was curious. I asked about it, and if the water pipes that normally supply the water to the machine had gone dry. She said in pretty good Finnish that she didn't understand the question. I presume she didn't know the word for water hose (*vesiletku*), so I repeated the question, this time pointing to the hose and pipes. She asked if I spoke any Russian. I didn't, but I had access to Google Translate.

As I was writing, she told me to ""stop bullying her"", which I first took as humorous banter between neighbours. I showed her the translation, but she *refused* to look at it, again repeating that I should stop bullying her, and that I should back off. Confused, I asked what she meant, but she took her own phone, began filming me, and said that if I would not stop ""bullying"" her she would send the video to the police (!?).

As she refused to even listen to my explanations, I stopped trying. I still had my dry laundry in the adjacent drying room, so what followed was kind of awkward 5 minutes as I folded my clothes up and she kept sitting on the laundry room bench. The threat to call the cops on me seemed very uncalled for, so I wanted to try one more time to set the record straigth. So I wrote a little ""sorry about that, I was just curious about the hose"" paragraph to explain and de-escalate the situation. She again refused to look at my phone, and said very rudely that she didn't want to talk to me nor see me. 

All our communication was in Finnish, as she refused to look at my attempted Russian translations.

Idk if I did anything wrong, but here are my theories to what might have gone wrong on my part:

* She said that she had reserved the laundry room, and took my presence as barging in. (However, the reservations are for the laundry machines, and I was picking up my dried up laundry. I had every right to be there)
* She took my (20-ish male) casual talking to her (35-45 yr woman) as some sort of sexual harrasment?
* She took my male presence as threatening? When I brought my phone closer to her face that she could read the translations, that's when she told me to back off. However, I was keeping the polite-distance-with-strangers the whole time.
* Russo-Finnish mistranslation? Although she spoke Finnish very well, she clearly didn't know some words.
* Cultural difference in something?

I had acted calm and casual (though increasingly confused) during the whole situation, but thought it was both very unwarranted and rude as fuck by the woman to begin filming me and threatening to call the cops on me. But maybe I missed something in the situation? AITA?

Obviously this is something that is important to you, and you don’t want him to violate your family’s cultural normative in front of them. He should respect that this is something that’s important to you. 

I feel that if you’re accommodating people of another culture, it is not rude to ask others to refrain from doing things considered taboo in that culture. Likewise, there are probably middle eastern customs that would be considered taboo in western culture, and I’d expect the same respect to go both ways in terms of not wanting to put the other in an uncomfortable situation that conflicts with their morals or customs.

Him calling you an AH over that is an overreaction.

If you have a better day adhering to those values, go for it. If it feels like you're being forced to uphold values you don't care about, then don't uphold them.

Why do you fear that lecture of your sister? You don't have to uphold every single tradtion at every opportunity to still value them and why would you adapting to new traditions and culture be such a bad thing?

I (27F) have been in a relationship with my BF (26M) for about 6 years now. For some context, I grew up in a Middle Eastern country before moving to the US. My family is pretty “liberal” in Middle East standards but there’s still certain things they aren’t comfortable with such as being around people drinking, PDA, etc. That’s all still pretty taboo to them. My sister (32F) is probably the second most strict person in my family, the first being my dad, in terms of being uncomfortable around those things. 

Anyway, it was my birthday the other day and my sister flew in to celebrate with me. My entire family lives back in my home country while I live in the US so I don’t see them often. My sister, my BF, and I went to celebrate in LA and stopped at Chipotle for lunch before heading to our next stop. I asked my BF what he was going to order and he said a burrito and a Heineken. I asked to please not get the beer as I knew how my sister was going to react and I just didn’t want to deal with the drama. She isn’t the type to make a scene or comment about it to his face, but I just know she’s going to use it as ammunition in case anything doesn’t go her way. It becomes a whole lecture of “You’re changing and not remembering who you are and blah blah  blah”. I just wanted to enjoy my birthday and not deal with that. 

My BF called me an AH for asking him not to drink beer as he wanted to enjoy the day. I understand where he’s coming from but at the same time, is it that big of a deal to not drink beer one time?

Post,1gpj4gz,AITA for turning off a performer's speaker in a Paris metro?,Philsidock,2024-11-12 12:01:51,"Hello there,

I was sitting in a Paris metro car, and two guys came onboard: the first with an accordion, and the second with a microphone and speaker. The second guy had the speaker and the microphone, and was standing next to me. 

The speaker was pretty loud, and the guy with the microphone was 25% hypeman/75% rapping in French. I don't like people imposing music on me, so in a VERY bold move, I turned off the speaker's power button. I had a short conversation with the microphone guy that went like this (in French):
Rapper: Why did you turn it off?
Me: Because no one wants to hear your music here.
Group of guys 20 feet away: Hey, you were feeling it man; we liked it!
Rapper: Yeah, you liked it?

The Rapper, Accordion Guy and I exchanged glances as we arrived to the next stop. The two of them got off, and no one said anything afterwards. I was on the metro for another five stops.

My question to you: was I the asshole in this situation? I'm leaning towards yes, but at the same time, I don't like when people perform on public transportion, and I feel I'm being held hostage.

P.S. I actually like street performers and donate to them when they're good, but I'm very much against people busking in places where you're trapped together. Also, I probably would not have done this NYC, for example, because there would be a much higher chance for a physical confrontation.

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 > (1) I turned off a performer's speaker on a metro car because I found it annoying and inappropriate. 

(2) It's a pretty bold move to touch another man's equipment, especially when they're performing for money or followers. It was likely embarassing for the performers as well.

By the same token, many people are not fans of people playing on public transport when there's no escape. But, it's best to not overreact, and there's also a chance that you're putting yourself at risk by interferring with ""performers.""

You probably don't talk as quietly as you think you do. Unless you have a really sensitive microphone that can pick up whispers, I guarantee that you're speaking louder than one should at night while others are sleeping.

>I ended up telling her that it's reasonable to want me to be quiet at night, but I'm not gonna be silent, we are both paying rent and we both have rights. I told her that at this point, it's not my problem

Then what are you on here for, asking if you're the asshole, if you've already made the decision that you won't change your behavior no matter what? You admit that it's reasonable for her to want you to be quiet, but then say you won't do it. 

It's a dick move to continue doing behavior that stops someone from sleeping. That can have serious health effects on your roommate.

I'm also a light sleeper and I've been close to states of psychosis before from being woken up repeatedly throughout the night and kept awake by things such as our pets making noise in the house or neighbors playing loud music. It's torture. Earplugs and white noise sometimes help when I'm like on day three of fucked up sleep and am so far gone with exhaustion, but normally they are ineffective.

Everyone is saying she can deal with it, this is the price of having a roommate, etc but no one is turning that same logic around on you. What is more important, your entitlement to be able to game and talk and make noise after midnight, or your roommate's entitlement to quiet hours? Just like people are saying ""tough shit"" to her, I would say the same to you. You want to game and make noise at those hours? Tough. I'd recommend getting a silent keyboard and only text chatting with friends. That would be the reasonable, mature, and in my mind obvious thing to do. I'd personally feel horrible if I knew I was disturbing someone's peace.

If you're absolutely committed to making noise after midnight you need to live alone or with a roommate who keeps similar hours.

With both doors closed, dampening o-rings installed, and a blanket on the wall, there should be ZERO audible sound from the keyboard.

I can't say the same for the voice, that may just be a frequency that carries easily, meaning you've got to stop with the party chat, sorry.

I used to work night shifts and share a place with a day shift housemate, I would also like to game after getting home, but I made sure that my gaming set up was in a room at the other end of the house, in a room with plenty of fabric and cushioning (to baffle the sound), put a door snake across the opening of the door and the hallway was carpeted, which also helped (you could try a rug). My housemate was able to sleep soundly with her door wide open if she wanted to, and often she wouldn't realise I was home until she was right outside the door.

I'm leaning towards YTA, only because it really doesn't sound like you're trying that hard to keep it down besides purchasing the o-rings.

YOU may enjoy your significantly shifted schedule of staying up all night, but most humans are diurnal, as evidenced by the majority of businesses being open and most jobs and classes being held roughly 9-5.

Pretty much every apartment building and shared living situation out there has quiet hours from 10pm to 7am, give or take.

Post,1gp9ema,AITA for telling my roommate to leave the bathroom door open?,West_Educator_8139,2024-11-12 01:40:33,"So I am one of four people in my apartment. Myself and two of the others generally get along. It's not perfect, but no roommate situation will be, and I'm fairly happy overall.

The remaining roommate (we'll call them Alex) is a bit of a different story. Throughout the few months that we've been living together, there have been a lot of issues related to Alex. Most is a minor annoyance, some is a more serious, but there is always something going on. And it always seems to be because of Alex. I'll also note that Alex is of a different culture than the rest of us, and also is from a different place than where we now live. We've tried to be understanding, but as with everything, sometimes there will be practices we disagree on.

About a week and a half ago, Alex started insisting on closing the bathroom door, even when no one is in the bathroom. Apparently this is a cultural aspect for them, where it's considered impolite to keep the bathroom door open. I do want to note that this wasn't an issue until months into living together? That doesn't make it less legitimate, but it stood out as odd to all of us that this wasn't brought up sooner.

All three of us have disagreed with closing the door. It's not about any particular cultural stance. We have issues with that door and handle sticking, so if it's closed, it's hard to tell if someone's in there or not. We don't want to keep it closed without others being in there to avoid this confusion. We have offered to leave it mostly closed, so it's still mostly hidden but you can see there's no one in there.

This came to a head earlier today. Alex had closed the door after leaving the bathroom. Some time later, I really needed to take a dump. I see that the door is closed so knock to see if anyone is in there. There's no response and so I try to open the door, but because the door and handle really like to stick, it doesn't open and so I assume that someone is actually in there. I end up waiting in the living room for the person to leave, all the while really needing to go and not having another place to do so. I eventually realize no one is actually in there, when I see Alex and the other two roommates at the same time. I run in there to release what I'd been holding, but once I got out I let Alex have it. My roommates were supportive of me, as this is a recurring issue for all of us and we want to leave it open.

Now, I probably went further than was reasonable and I take credit for that. I got mad about having to hold that dump in and wanted to let it out, but could've handled the response more maturely. However, I still think that it was ultimately reasonable for me to take issue with this. We offered an option that would keep the area closed to sight while still making it easy to get into, and Alex didn't take that. It's not like we're insisting on keeping it gaping open against their traditions.

If he continues to refuse, you may need to get creative to keep your lives sane. I lived in a “suite” of people who shared a bathroom and we had to get creative to make our shared bathroom work, as it was connected to two rooms and closing and reopening both doors every time we used the bathroom was a hassle.

We got very good at knocking, and being loud with our responses. Our bathroom also had a bright light and a loud fan that came on alongside it, so it was easy to tell if the light/fan was on (usually meant someone was in there).

Does your bathroom have a fan? Can you enforce the rule “fan on means in use”?

Can you make the lighting brighter, so it shines under the door?

Can you all aggressively start using door locks, so it’s always safe to check? Or be prepared to be communicative about whether you’re using it or not?

You could get a vacant/occupied sign. Everyone would have to get in the habit of using it, but it could work.

All of these solutions unfortunately involve buy in and good communication from all housemates: something that seems like a challenge in your situation! But it might be better to work with your housemate rather than fight, and maybe you can find a compromise that works for everyone.",96,0,,,NTA,

Not wanting the poop room door to be open to the rest of the apartment is a reasonable stance.

Lodge a request with your landlord to get the handle fixed.

And next time you knock, if there’s no answer, loudly say you’ve heard no response and are entering the room. Then enter the room.

“I got mad about having to hold in that dump.” It’s not Alex’s fault you decided there was someone in the bathroom despite having knocked and gotten no response. That’s entirely on you.

“I do want to note that this wasn’t an issue until months into living together?” Or it took him that long to be comfortable raising it. Or he thought he could live with it as he’d been outvoted, but in practice disliked the smell. You’re allowed to change your mind about how you all live together after experiencing it for some time. What you shouldn’t be doing is screaming at someone because you decided to hold in a dump based on zero evidence that the bathroom was occupied.",25,0,,,YTA,

NTA, your wording is wrong. You didn't really catfish him in this situation because it's not like you tried to get anything selfish out of it. You helped him beat the algorithms and gain extra followers because you were watching and interacting. He showed up when others searched for his niche. 

Your bf is an ass. There is a large chance he told your secret on purpose out of jealousy. Personally, I think you should have taken this to the grave.


Sit down with your friend and have a real conversation with him. I apologize for the bf being the reason he found out.

A few years ago my (26F) roommate (26M) started streaming games on twitch. The guy has a serious follow thru problem. If he doesn't see immediate success, he gets depressed and give up. I really wanted him to give it a good try, so I made an account, followed him and started chatting with him as a teenaged boy. He came out of his room the next day beaming about his first follower. I kept it up for a few months until he had what I thought was a decent following for a new streamer and returned to my regular sleep schedule (he would stream 7pm to 1am) 
Last week my boyfriend who I told about it let slip that I was the teen boy and he got pissed. He started saying he wanted to get big on his own (he has about 1,200 followers now) I explained that I didn't want him to give up early and knew that people probably wouldn't join the stream if no one else was watching, but he insisted that I pity him and think he can't do anything without my help. I do have a tendency to try to help my friends with these kinds of things whether they ask me to or not. I really was just trying to do a nice thing for him.

At first, I thought you weren’t, but as I was writing, I realized you were.

Your friend really wanted to succeed on his own (which is tricky with streaming, since an audience is obviously necessary). Still, you could have shown support in a respectful way.

You could have followed him on Twitch openly, not hiding your identity, to let him know you were there for him.

Alternatively, you could have watched anonymously and kept it to yourself. But instead, you chose to talk about it with others, which could be embarrassing or degrading for your friend.

You agree you have a tendency to “help” people even when they don’t want it, which suggests you may not fully respect their boundaries.

Your friend clearly didn't want it so yes, it's a breach of his trust, even if it was something good (according to you)

And your boyfriend doesn't seem to be trustworthy tbh be careful with that

It's not your job to do such things for other people when they don't ask for it, you're patronising them, you're saying you don't trust them to figure it out on their own.

This is serious for you and your relationships, if you continue to do this you will end up surrounded by lazy people or people that will take advantage of the fact that you do things that are not being asked of you.

If you're willing to put yourself first, I recommend therapy.
If you can't afford therapy, I'll just recommend asking them if they needs help with whatever, if they say no, just respect that and focus on yourself because you deserve it, you deserve time and energy spent on you and the best person to start doing it, it's yourself.",-2,0,,,YTA,

Post,1gp0bxs,WIBTA if I don’t go to my boyfriend’s family home for Christmas?,throwawaychi2,2024-11-11 19:11:05,"I (28F) am not close with my parents (long story short, they’re not exactly good people), but I’m always cordial with them and have always come home for Christmas. 


Last year, I invited my boyfriend (28M) to come if he wanted (after asking my parents—they were fine with it), and he came and we had a good time. 


This year, he’s inviting me to come to his parents’ house for Christmas. I like his parents, but I must admit I don’t really want to go because (this may be shallow) I don’t think it will be as fun. My parents, for all their flaws, like to have a good time—there’s always lots of alcohol, great food, and general festivity at their house over the holidays. Even more importantly, Christmas week has always been a time for me and my sister (who live in different cities) to hang out and have fun. 


My boyfriend’s parents don’t drink, they don’t do anything special for holiday meals, and they live in a suburb far from fun activities. His sister and her husband have a just-turned-one-year-old, so the chances that we’re going to be able to go out and have fun with them are somewhat slim. More than anything, I’ll miss my sister. However, if she goes back to her city for New Year’s Eve, I may visit and see her then. 


Re: my boyfriend’s situation: he’s not particularly close with his family either, but I think he feels he should come see them this year since he was with my family last year. I think he wants me to come both because, of course, it’s nice to be together over the holidays, and because my being there will make things more fun for him. He says he’ll try his best to make things fun, and I believe him. 


Re: my sister: I’ve talked with her, and while she’d like to see me over Christmas, she’s says she’s okay with my going to my boyfriend’s parents’ if it’s what I want to do, especially since we might see each other over New Year’s.


WIBTA if I didn’t go to my boyfriend’s parents for Christmas simply because I don’t think I’ll have as much fun? 

Edit: typos 

More info, in case relevant: I went to his family home for Thanksgiving last year, and I’ve hung out with his parents and grandparents a decent amount. I like them and am normally eager to see them; it’s just over Christmas that I don’t want to do it.

More more info: Maybe I should have mentioned this earlier, but family is Jewish, and they don’t attach as much importance to Christmas as some people do, but they do exchange presents, so I think it’s still fair to say that they celebrate it.

I (28F) am not close with my parents (long story short, they’re not exactly good people), but I’m always cordial with them and have always come home for Christmas. 


Last year, I invited my boyfriend (28M) to come if he wanted (after asking my parents—they were fine with it), and he came and we had a good time. 


This year, he’s inviting me to come to his parents’ house. I like his parents, but I must admit don’t really want to go because (this may be shallow), I don’t think it will be as fun. My parents, for all their flaws, know how to have a good time—there’s always lots of alcohol, great food, and general festivity at their house over the holidays. Even more importantly, Christmas week has always been a time for me and my sister (who live in different cities) to hang out and have fun. 


My boyfriend’s parents don’t drink, they don’t do anything special for holiday meals, and they live in a suburb far from fun activities. His sister and her husband have a just-turned-one-year-old, so the chances that we’re going to be able to go out and have fun with them are somewhat slim. More than anything, I’ll miss my sister. However, if she goes back to her city for New Year’s Eve, I may visit and see her then. 


Re: my boyfriend’s situation: he’s not particularly close with his family either, but I think he feels he should come see them this year since he was with my family last year. I think he wants me to come both because, of course, it’s nice to be together over the holidays, and because my being there will make things more fun for him. He says he’ll try his best to make things fun, and I believe him. 


Re: my sister: I’ve talked with her, and while she’d like to see me over Christmas, she’s says she’s okay with my going to my boyfriend’s parents’ if it’s what I want to do, especially we might see each other over New Year’s.

The alcohol being your priority isn't even the biggest one.  

Christmas isn't a Jewish holiday; if anything it's the most un-Jewish holiday there is. It's literally celebrating the birth of the Christian Messiah. Christianity spun off from (and generally violently disavowed the connection to) Judaism, so why would they celebrate Christmas? (And yes I am aware that there's an increasingly large percentage of the population who think Christmas is a secular holiday. It's not. Thanks, capitalism.)

Then there's your comments about how your future with this guy depends on the post-educational phase of your lives. Why are you with him? 

 If you're in a relationship for the long haul, family is usually part of the equation. If you're so disinterested in his family now, do you really want to spend the rest of your life with them?

Post,1goqgfw,AITAH for telling my brother not to make himself a sandwich while my girlfriend cleans the kitchen? ,StateLongjumping432,2024-11-11 11:53:09,"Throw away because my girlfriend wouldn't want me to post this under my real username.

My girlfriend (35F) and I (36M) are hosting my brother (34M) for two weeks, because he has a training in our city. It's the first time we've hosted him for this long (usually he comes visit for just a weekend), and for such a long stay, differences in eating habits, cleanliness, helpfulness with chores, etc. are starting to clash (politely, but still).

My girlfriend and I spend a few hours on Saturdays cleaning our apartment and cooking for the next few days. I was hopping my brother would at least propose to help but he hasn't, he went for a walk when we started, came back later and stayed on his laptop, then took a nape. At 4pm he was hungry (he had snaked on a hot dog in town during his walk instead of coming back to eat with us for lunch), so he asked me if he can make himself a sandwich. I said ""sure but if \[my girlfriend\] is cleaning the kitchen, you should wait, or eat a banana or an apple"". I know that my girlfriend doesn't want anyone in the way when she's cleaning a room. She is using that time to call her family. Besides, I was already a bit annoyed that my brother hadn't proposed to help, so to go as far as sitting in the kitchen eating a sandwich while she is cleaning, I found this rude.

He doesn't want a banana and would like bread and ham. I said ""ask \[girlfriend\] if you can, but don't be surprised if she says no"". He went in the kitchen to ask. She was cleaning and calling her mom. The kitchen table was full of stuff (blender, soap, etc.) that she had just put aside, she would have needed to move them to make space for him, or let him use the counter, which she was cleaning. She pointed him to the fruit basket and, just like I did, told him he can have a fruit. He didn't take anything. He came back to me and complained that we are ""extreme"" for not letting him have a sandwich, that he has never seen that anywhere, and that anyone would find it abnormal. I had no response. To me it sounded absolutely normal that if you are invited in someone's home, especially for such a long stay, you don't get in their way when they are busy cleaning. But my girlfriend's mother had overheard on the phone when he had come into the kitchen, and told my girlfriend ""come on, let him have his sandwich, the poor thing will starve"", so she came out and told him he could have it. Now I'm not sure whether we are the AH for telling him no in the first place?

EDIT to make it extra clear: I'm not expecting him to deep-clean our house. I'm expecting him to do the minimum (like putting his cup in the dishwasher, not making a mess that we have to clean after, etc.), I'm a bit annoyed that he doesn't naturally chip in to help when he can, but mostly because that's what I do when I'm invited somewhere (including his place). I see my host doing dishes? I'll take a dishcloth and start drying them, for instance. Or if I'm staying several days, I'll offer to cook a couple of meals. But my post was more about the specific situation of asking him not to go in the kitchen while my girlfriend was cleaning, v.s. my brother thinking he should be able to make himself a sandwich whenever he feels like (and I'm not even strict on that, he made himself a sandwich in the middle of the night, I have no issues with it).",3644,940,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1goqgfw/aitah_for_telling_my_brother_not_to_make_himself/,"The final verdict is: **Not the A-hole**

He’s visiting, go spend time with him! Join him on his walk, take him to see some sights, make the most of your time with him. Home deep cleaning is not a quality shared activity.

Pick a temperature you can tolerate use fans, wear cooler clothes, etc. And though it’ll still be colder for her than she likes, it should be warm enough that she should be able to make herself comfortable enough in warmer clothes and maybe adding a heater to her room.

If she’s unwilling to budge, I’d say there’s nothing wrong with stripping down to your underwear in your own space—but if you go to a common area, throw a shirt and some shorts on to do whatever you gotta do real quick.

70 is just the standard for any home, and that's because it's a perfect temperature. Just set the thermostat to 67-70 degrees Fahrenheit and call it a day. 

Going in your underwear around a roommate is not the solution. They didn't consent to seeing you almost naked. And worse, you're probably just going to embarrass yourself when she has people over.

In short, ESH. Be adults and talk it out. Compromise on you drinking cold drinks and her using an electric blanket or heater in her own room.",13,0,,,ESH,

Roommate keeps setting the temperature up to 76 degrees. I start overheating at 68. 

We’ve been arguing about this for months with no resolution. We just keep switching it back and forth whenever the other isn’t looking. 

We don’t pay for AC/heating so cost isn’t an issue, and even if it was, it’s been in the low 40s/50s outside so keeping it cooler isn’t costing anything.

I’m getting sick of it. I can feel when she sets the heat back up (multiple times a day) because I start sweating through my shirt. I don’t want to deal with this. 

I realize that I run pretty cold and I might be a little sensitive to heat. I like it closer to 63, but am willing to compromise to 67 or 68. I feel sick when I walk in and it’s above 70. Especially because I have to dress warm to go outside. 

I’m super frustrated and I don’t want to deal with fighting over this or arguing. I’m very strongly considering giving up and letting her set the temperature to whatever she wants and just stripping down to my underwear when I get too hot. I know this will make her uncomfortable but I’m not sure what else I’m supposed to do if she keeps cranking the heat up.

Post,1go5p9d,AITA for asking my sister to replace my jellybeans after her son ate them?,Smooth_Instruction11,2024-11-10 17:22:08,"
So, I (25M) recently invited my family over for dinner at my new condo. I’m really proud of this place—it took years of saving, hard work, and sacrifice to get here. It’s small, but it’s mine, and I wanted to celebrate with a nice family dinner.

I decided to make homemade spaghetti carbonara. I spent hours on it: crisped pancetta, freshly grated Parmesan, whisked with eggs and pasta water for a perfect, silky sauce. Carbonara is all about timing and texture, so I was in the kitchen paying close attention to every step. I added garlic bread, salad, and even made a cheesecake for dessert. It was a big effort, and I wanted the evening to feel special.

Now, I keep a big jar of jellybeans on my coffee table as a treat. I love picking out a few here and there, and I always save the Cream Soda ones for last—they’re my favorite. The jar has lasted a long time, and it’s something I enjoy after a long day.

My sister Laura (35F) brought her 7-year-old son, who’s honestly a bit of a handful. He’s not used to hearing “no” and thinks every space is his to do what he wants. My sister has never set limits with him, and growing up, our parents spoiled her too.

While I was busy in the kitchen, my nephew found the jellybean jar. I didn’t notice at first because I was trying to get the carbonara just right. After dinner, I went to grab a handful of jellybeans and realized that almost all the Cream Soda ones were gone. My nephew had picked them out, leaving a mess of crumbs and broken bits.

I pulled Laura aside and mentioned it, asking if she’d noticed. She just shrugged and said, “Oh, he only likes the Cream Soda ones, so he picked those out. No big deal.” I tried to be polite, but I told her that those were my favorites and asked if she could replace them, or at least get me some more of the Cream Soda flavor.

She got annoyed and snapped, “He’s just a kid. You’re seriously this worked up over some jellybeans?” I told her it wasn’t about the jellybeans, but that it would’ve been nice if she’d kept an eye on him or taught him to ask. Laura rolled her eyes and said, “Then don’t leave temptations out if you don’t want kids touching them.”

I asked her one more time to either replace the jar or just the Cream Soda ones, but she refused, calling me “petty” and saying I was blowing things out of proportion. My parents jumped in to back her up, telling me to “drop it” and that I should “know better than to have temptations out around kids.”

But it’s not just about the money—it’s about respect and boundaries. I put a lot into that dinner, and her response was to let her son treat my place like his personal candy store. Now my family thinks I’m overreacting, but to me, this is about respecting boundaries.

AITA for asking my sister to replace the Cream Soda jellybeans her son ate?

Edit:

I’ll accept my verdict since apparently it is normal these days to allow a child to root through a jar of jellybeans like a hog looking for truffles.

What I won’t accept, what I won’t tolerate, is the insults about my competency as a home chef.

Let me walk you through it, so you understand why real carbonara takes time and why cutting corners would be a disgrace.

First, I went to this authentic Italian market with shelves stacked high with imported goods, where the scent of cured meats fills the air. They carry real pancetta, flown in weekly, and I spent ages with the owner, Domenico, who handpicked the perfect wedge of Parmigiano-Reggiano for me—a rich, nutty block that was almost too beautiful to grate.

Next, I stopped at this tiny, family-owned shop that specializes in fresh farm eggs and produce. Carla, the owner, gets these eggs from a nearby farm, and each one is an intense, deep golden color, perfect for a creamy, rich sauce. 

Finally, I swung by a Salumeria for semolina flour. It sounds dramatic, but that’s the lengths I go for traditional pasta. The place feels like a rustic old-world bakery, with walls lined in wooden shelves and burlap sacks stacked high. Their semolina flour has a texture and richness that just doesn’t compare—ideal for handmade pasta that holds up with the perfect al dente bite.

Back home, I crafted the pasta from scratch. Flour piled on the counter, eggs nestled into a well, kneading it with care until the dough was soft and elastic, a process that took a solid 15 minutes of arm work. Then, I let the dough rest before rolling it into long ribbons, each one dusted lightly with flour, like fresh snow.

Finally, I crisped the pancetta, grated the cheese by hand, and whisked the eggs to the perfect consistency. The sauce had to be watched like a hawk—just enough heat to turn it creamy without scrambling, with careful additions of pasta water to reach that glossy, silken texture.

So yes, it took hours. And I’m not ashamed to say that.",1574,1758,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1go5p9d/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_replace_my/,"The final verdict is: **Asshole**

A person is either a professional cook, a professional chef, or a home cook. Non-professionals - people who have not come up through the apprentice system or had other professional training (like culinary school) - are cooks. 

It appears to me that you are a foodie: someone who has a passion for food and likes to prepare different dishes at home. Nothing wrong with that. I know plenty of foodies who are great cooks.

Just so you’re aware, carbonara is meant to be a quick, uncomplicated dish. Something simple but tasty. If it takes you hours to make it then you might want to address your time management skills in the kitchen.

I think it’s great that you shop carefully, choose quality ingredients, and love cooking for other people. But there’s no need to turn carbonara into something pretentious or time-consuming.

The most important part of preparing food is getting it done. Timing matters. Efficiency matters. You don’t have to do everything at a dog trot like we do in professional kitchens but you should work as quickly as you’re able. Food doesn’t improve by sitting or waiting. Get it done.

As far as your family situation goes I actually think that you’re trying to exert control over your nephew being indulged because you never had any control over your sister being spoiled when you were kids.

Let it go. It’s not the kid’s fault that he’s spoiled. And your parents are always going to back their golden child, your sister. You’ve got your own place now so you can let all that go and enjoy your home.

Comment,1go5p9d,AITA for asking my sister to replace my jellybeans after her son ate them?,tnscatterbrain,2024-11-11 07:27:32,"YTA for expecting anyone to read your description of making the food.  There’s a reason most recipe sites have the skip to the actual recipe option. 

I’ve always thought it’s a little rude for the host to spend upon hours upon hours tucked away in the kitchen, but you’re family so that’s a bit different and maybe they were in there with you at least some of the time. 

If you leave candy out when you have people over, it’s pretty natural that they’d think it’s ok to grab some.  
A lot of people keep little treats in jars or bowls out for company. 

The longer they’re there, the more they’re likely to have. And again, they’re family, things are usually more casual with family. 
Children have even less impulse control than adults, so of course if they see it they want it.  

If I saw a candy jar with a disproportionate amount of one flavour I’d think the owner didn’t like those and would be more likely to take a few extra of those if I l liked them. 

Your sister should be teaching her child to not pick through candy jars (though of course anyone would just use their hands, what are people going to do, go get a spoon?) and take all of one flavour but if you are only willing to share a set amount or certain flavours, don’t leave the candy jar out when you have company.  

I’d apologize if my child took all of one flavour without asking because it’s not polite, but I’d also be tempted to buy you those jellybeans for every birthday and Christmas for eternity if you were genuinely disturbed over this.",14,0,,,YTA,

Comment,1go5p9d,AITA for asking my sister to replace my jellybeans after her son ate them?,richesca,2024-11-11 01:59:55,"I think calling anyone an asshole in this situation is a bit extreme, I mean they’re only jellybeans you can replace them. You can buy whole bags on Amazon. However there are faults with everyone involved here so I may go with ESH. 

Firstly, if you didn’t want anyone taking your favourite flavour of jellybean and you knew a kid was coming over then you should’ve just hidden the jar altogether. There was no reason to have it out and even if your sister knew you’d hidden it and asked you about it you could’ve said you didn’t want anyone to lose their appetite with sweets when you’d spent so long making the meal. 

Secondly the sister is an AH for allowing her kid to route round in a load of jellybeans in someone else’s house without asking if he could even have any. I wouldn’t have dreamed of doing that as a kid because I was brought up with manners and the knowledge that I should ask if I wanted something. 

The kid is 7, that is plenty old enough to learn how to ask for things you want and not go routing around in other peoples food like a hungry pig looking for truffles lol

I might also add, I know you spent a lot of time making the pasta and sourcing the ingredients, but why? You’re making the meal for your family on a normal occasion. I’m assuming, since you didn’t mention anything, that this was just a general family meal get together. Also there’s a kid involved, who is not going to care about how much effort you put in sadly. 
You’re obviously not just angry about the fact that your favourite jellybean is gone, you feel disrespected because you put so much effort into the meal and the kid ruined it, in your eyes, by eating all your favourite jellybeans. 

I’m sorry but you brought this feeling upon yourself. Maybe take a step back and look at the event with unbiased eyes and maybe see that your nephew eating a few jellybeans isn’t really a massive deal and instead of putting your sister on the spot and making her responsible you could just buy replacements.",5,0,,,ESH,

especially not while someone is actively cooking us dinner. my parents would be so upset with me if i was rude enough to pick through someone’s candy right before dinner without asking.

the kid is 7. that’s old enough to have some manners for goodness sake. the words “may i please” are not beyond a 7 year old’s comprehension unless he has a developmental disability. and if he does… it’s mom’s job to help him and take responsibility for his actions. like, say, replacing candy he raided without asking.

“i keep a jar of jelly beans on MY coffee table in MY CONDO” is not an open invitation. next time, put it away in a cabinet or something when they come over since clearly they cant be bothered to ask first, and it’s demonstrably more rude to rifle through someone’s pantry for snacks right next to them while they’re cooking for you.",74,0,,,NTA,

All is fair in love and war. You honestly expressed your feelings and you did not go out of the way to manipulate the situation one way or the other.

The fact that you called anyone fat is no necesarilly something that should come out of someone’s mouth even if it is the reason. but… given the fact that he was tossing you around about dating his best friend while having rejected you multiple times for whatever reason he had, you have all the reason to feel angry and slightly spiteful with how he treated you and in response give him a spiteful response yourself. Again, it’s not the greatest idea to be honest about physical features now a days even though we ALL have them and think about them when considering someone to be involved with. I don’t think you’re the asshole from the context and situation you described but I don’t think you helped yourself in not being perceived that way by him or other people who might hear about it. People are likely to twist that shit unless you tell them the reality of the situation and do exactly what you did in recovery, that being apologizing.

In simple terms. Why did him teasing you hurt you so much? That's why it sounds like it was - just him being goofy, or alternatively, he may have liked *you*. A more appropriate response, if his teasing made you uncomfortable, would have been a private conversation. Instead, you were really rude to him, possibly broke his heart, and damaged your relationship, maybe forever. 

If you want to preserve your friendship, maybe have a private conversation and apologize again and explain that his jokes made you uncomfortable and that's why you lashed out inappropriately. It doesn't excuse it, but may help him understand why it happened.",-8,0,,,YTA,
Post,1gnu1kh,AITA: Wife(24F)thinks I’m(32M)being sneaky because I don’t want her and the boys to come on my work trips ,WestBass9894,2024-11-10 05:58:41,"I’ve very fortunate to work a job that pays well and allows me to travel the world doing what I love . But sometimes with a wife and two boys and job that requires you to travel isn’t ideal . 

But I’m not interested in other work because like I said it’s what I love and I’m lucky and blessed financially. 

Sometimes I bring my wife and children on the trips but this time I decided not to and my wife is getting suspicious and thinks I’m being sneaky. 

Honestly I don’t blame her I can understand where she’s coming from. Lovers get jealous/see red flags and ask questions I understand that I’ve had my moments of jealously too but the truth is I don’t want to bring her and the kids because it stops being a work trip and a becomes a vacation where I also got to work WHILE ALSO catering to her and the boys in her mind it’s like in her mind I’m not working 

Instead of a three day trip where I go to work and come back home  it now becomes a week plus long vacation where we have to do all the tourist things I’ve done a million times for the last several years. A vacation with two boys isn’t the most peaceful vacation in the world either. But she thinks I’m being sneaky . 

But the truth is I rather go do what I have to do , watch some tv in the hotel room without the boys screaming , smoke some weed and come back to my family in a couple days. I do enjoy the small periods alone but It’s not like I have some secret family I’m traveling to see nor am I planning trips to purposely get away but when it happens I do enjoy it by myself.  This has caused suspicion and a riff in my household. 

Should I just tell her to come ? But wouldn’t that be more suspicious? Like she caught me ? Does that mean I can’t take any trips without them anymore I have to bring them everytime? No more solo work trips ? I’ve gone on this trips long before even meeting my wife What should I do? We have a pretty strong relationship and I would hate for something so small to cause us problems .

TLDR : don’t want wife to come on work trips with me she believes I’m being sneaky

Does she need a break? 

You need to have that conversation with her and see if she's struggling with the periods of lone parenting. 

It sounds like to me that she views your work trips as mini vacations for yourself and she doesn't get those opportunities.  

A conversation can very easily help you both decide what is necessary to build a healthy home for your children and yourselves.

Is there a family member that can stay with the kids so she could join you once in a while? It might be nice for you two to have that little getaway every now and then, assuming she’s independent enough to entertain herself while you work.

This sub is toxic toward male, particularly fathers. You're going to work, it's perfectly normal to not want your kids and spouse around in your work environment at any moments. It doesn't mean they can't come, but you have to establish clear boundaries or perhaps organize things so that you can afford to actually spend time with them if they do come.

What about finding a work trip that you know will be more relaxed and extending it for a couple of days of vacation for your wife and sons? Spend 2-3 days doing work stuff. Have your wife and sons arrive on the 4th or 5th day (gives you a chance to properly conclude your work, take a breather, and prep yourself and the accomodation for their arrival). Spend a week-end or however long you want/can afford with them. Leave for next business trip while they return home.

That's how my family does it. They'll just fly the kids/spouse to wherever they are *after* or *when* work allows it.",3,0,,,NTA,

But these are *work* trips. Turning work trips into vacations every time you have to travel for work sounds…really hard. Maybe I’m biased (scratch that, I clearly am) because I also have to travel so much for work and also have to leave my spouse and two kids. I have brought them before, but rarely—these are work trips. I’m working almost the entire time. They’re hardly vacations, and I don’t really sightsee or anything. Several of my trips this year have been overseas to a European country,  and o get a lot ‘you’re so lucky’ and yes, I realize that I am, but they also think I’m out hiking or sightseeing every evening/weekend, when in reality I’m working 12-hour days, going back to my tiny room and working until I fall asleep. It’s a work trip. If I were trying to squeeze a vacation with my family into that schedule, it’d be impossible. Especially with two young kids—mine are 8 and 2—because you’re right, vacations with kids aren’t really *vacations*, it’s parenting with a different background while completely out of your element.

But there’s obviously a trust issue here. My husband has never once thought I was being unfaithful on one of my work trips. We communicate constantly when I’m out of town, he knows exactly what I’m doing at all times (because he’s my best friend and I tell him and send him photos and reels and shit *all day*). There needs to be better communication if you want to continue traveling so much for work. 

Hitting up a counselor together when you are home isn’t a bad idea. It doesn’t mean there are problems—my husband and I have seen one before as a preventative measure because we were facing some hard shit as a family. Maybe the suggestion would be an olive branch to your wife that you’re taking your relationship and the effect your traveling has on it seriously. Because you traveling for work *does* greatly affect your family.",3,0,,,NAH,

Obviously traveling for work and likely working long hours while doing so is exhausting. However, it’s also possible there is a lot of responsibility put on the wife during these times OP is gone (and potentially even when he’s home).

OP mentions sometimes they come along, but it’s not clear if it’s “once or twice he’s let them” or if it’s happened a decent amount of time. How often is OP traveling? Was there a lack of communication regarding this particular trip and she’s just suddenly finding out they aren’t going along, because that would make sense as to why it would be disappointing and suspicious.

It’s not clear how old these kids are, nor how old she was when she got saddled with solo parenting for when OP is traveling for work. Does she get help at home, and does she get solo time to herself? Does she have family nearby or is she primarily alone other than the kids? Has she had much opportunity to travel with and/or without kids? She is so young and missing out on a lot if she is primarily only home with the kids and not traveling or is only rarely able to go on OPs work trips, that would be quite isolating if she doesn’t have help or a lot of family around.

To put it in perspective, I work in the best performing center in my company as a Training coordinator, unfortunately due to this my company asks me to travel to the other sites that are underperforming or straight up failed the companies mock-audit we do every 3 months to make sure that we're ready for whenever FDA decides to show up. So my job is to go to that center and see what tf is going on, train literally everyone (yes even management because we require management to also be signed off in every area, and if they were properly following our SOPs they wouldn't have failed) and get them ""FDA ready"". And let me tell you, it's made me want to quit multiple times. Don't get me wrong, I love the extra money, but it's not a vacation. Whenever I'm sent out I at minimum work 40 hours a week,(usually around 60 hours-75hours) on my feet the whole time, training, dealing with patients, writing a report for corporate, ECT. Trust me when I say I'm not even in the mood to go out in my one day off out of the week. The only reasons I actually take those trips is because 1. It's a shit ton of money, and 2. If I don't they send someone from corporate and I'm not going to lie, they have no idea how it's like to actually do work. They actively fired full departments when it was poor management that was the problem. I've only ""recommended"" they fire 3 people in my time doing this and one of them was a manager.  on top of that if  they still fail an FDA audit it's basically over, everyone's job is at risk. I don't want patients to be in danger or people losing their jobs when I know I'm capable of doing something about it. The only reason I'm saying this is to show y'all the stress I'm in when I do work trips. If I'm not actively working I'm in the hotel writing a report to corporate in the hotel, I'm talking to their management to see how to improve their center, I'm literally only resting when I sleep.My spouse understands this because she's been to those trips with me, she saw me less at my work trips than when we're home. Like legit the only reason I haven't quit is because the manager at the center I work at is chill and lets me take an actual vacation after those trips. Op I think this is more of a communication issue than anything else, actually sit her down and talk to her, and if she's always with the kids ask her if she wants time to herself, give her time to herself, tell her that you'll arrange alone time for her and plan for those dedicated times, because while jealousy might be the issue it could be jealousy from you being able to ""get away"" even if you're not actually getting away from anything.",3,0,,,NAH,

That’s not equivalent.

When he’s not with the kids, he is working… on a trip for work. Idk why people are acting like he’s taking vacations all the time, that is not what is being described.

Also the people acting like being a SAHM is the equivalent of working a professional job 24/7, you are out of your mind. There is nowhere near the stres to perform as a SAHM and kids flat out do not need constant attention past a certain age. 

Like do people think that preponderance of rich women opting to be SAHMs to be indicative of them choosing the harder alternative? 😂

I mean past the age of 4 or so they should be able to entertain themselves mostly, correct? My parents were insistent I learn to tend to myself past age 4 or so in terms of play, getting outside with friends, etc. I think it was about that age when they insisted upon my independence in bathing and choosing clothes for the day, yet there seems to be insane standards with some modern parents that kids schedule, clothes, etc. gets managed to a much later age.

Post,1gnyd75,AITA for moving out of my apartment even though my first roommate said they were first.,Opening-Lie-498,2024-11-10 11:08:54,"So I got a text from one of my roommates a few days ago (3 of us) and it was as follows:

Roommate: Hey I'm gonna be honest I might move back home either by the end of this year or the end of the next semester. It's been really hard and this week was the breaking point for me. But I honestly still don't know but I just want to keep you informed because you live here and it would impact u as well

OP: Alrighty thanks for letting me know. I hope everything works out tho. You do what you feel is best for you, don't worry about anyone else rn. Put yourself first.

After I got this message I went out to tour apartments and figure where to live. I found one yesterday and submitted the documents needed to move in. I won't get an official confirmation for another week, but I decided to let my roommate know my plans. Later today I get a response from them saying how their text was purely hypothetical and was just ranting and that they weren't at all serious. I proceeded to tell them I had no way of knowing that it was hypothetical and that they seemed very serious. Then we argued for eight hours essentially. Starting with them being pissed off that I was even leaving in the first place. I had told them I planned to be out by November 22nd, but they wanted me to still pay them and their bf (roommate 3) for December rent. I replied with if I'm still there then I will, if I'm not I won't. I'm not on the lease at our current place, only them two are, so if anybody tips off management, we're all screwed. There was drama with our friend group as well that also lead to the roommates initial message. My roommate continued to try and belittle me because I am a push over essentially, but I wasn't having it today, so their tone changed into trying to guilt trip me into staying, saying how they can't afford it with them and their bf and yadayada. Begging me to stay even though they were the ones who put me in that same spot a few days ago, without any hint that they weren't serious about their first message.

The fact that it was a message from your roommate that precipitated you looking for a new place to live puts you in the clear on a technicality, and the gaslighting and guilt tripping  is sketch, doesn't mean that they still don't deserve ample notice, even if you aren't on the lease. You have to look out for yourself, but do unto others. If the roles were reversed, what would you expect?",23,0,,,NTA,

So I got a text from one of my roommates a few days ago (3 of us) and it was as follows:

Roommate: Hey I'm gonna be honest I might move back home either by the end of this year or the end of the next semester. It's been really hard and this week was the breaking point for me. But I honestly still don't know but I just want to keep you informed because you live here and it would impact u as well

OP: Alrighty thanks for letting me know. I hope everything works out tho. You do what you feel is best for you, don't worry about anyone else rn. Put yourself first.

After I got this message I went out to tour apartments and figure where to live. I found one yesterday and submitted the documents needed to move in. I won't get an official confirmation for another week, but I decided to let my roommate know my plans. Later today I get a response from them saying how their text was purely hypothetical and was just ranting and that they weren't at all serious. I proceeded to tell them I had no way of knowing that it was hypothetical and that they seemed very serious. Then we argued for eight hours essentially. Starting with them being pissed off that I was even leaving in the first place. I had told them I planned to be out by November 22nd, but they wanted me to still pay them and their bf (roommate 3) for December rent. I replied with if I'm still there then I will, if I'm not I won't. I'm not on the lease at our current place, only them two are, so if anybody tips off management, we're all screwed. There was drama with our friend group as well that also lead to the roommates initial message. My roommate continued to try and belittle me because I am a push over essentially, but I wasn't having it today, so their tone changed into trying to guilt trip me into staying, saying how they can't afford it with them and their bf and yadayada. Begging me to stay even though they were the ones who put me in that same spot a few days ago, without any hint that they weren't serious about their first message. I talked about the whole situation with my good friends and they say I'm not in the wrong, but I come here asking reddit AITAH.

If you want more information or have questions, leave it in the comments and I will do my best to answer anything.

Comment,1gnyd75,AITA for moving out of my apartment even though my first roommate said they were first.,PristineLack8182,2024-11-11 19:01:04,"IMO it's a little jumping the gun.  The roommate did not definitely say that they would be leaving or by when. 
However the roommate also did not make it abundantly clear that they were only considering this as an option and had not made a final choice.

The roommate left things very vague. End of semester or end of year is the difference between a few weeks from now as opposed to a few months from now. So it makes sense you were looking out for yourself. There's no harm in that.

 You are also in the situation that you *have* to find a new place to live. They already have housing secured. You should be active and aggressive in finding new places to live. 

Could and should you have been rational adults and talked this out? Yes. This would have solved everything going on rn. 

But given how unsure the roommate sounds, the fact that you aren't on the lease, announcing via text something rather important, i don't feel like that sit down conversation would have happened or ended well. They really don't seem like they have their shit together. 

You told them to look out for their best interest, and you are looking out for yours. From their own words, you had potentially 30 days to find new accommodations. So you did. You aren't obligated to wait till they make a decision to then put a plan into action. Plus you aren't even legally required to do anything if you aren't on the lease so they can't do anything if you moved out tomorrow. And they can't force you to pay rent for time you aren't there. 

Are you an asshole? Not really. You are responding to a situation of their own making. Sucks to be them. Lack of planning on their part does not constitute a rapid response on yours.",1,0,,,,

",CyberTractor,2024-11-09 19:00:28,"YTA for putting yourself in a situation where you don't have clear agreements on how ownership of an expensive asset is divided.  Everything from the initial purchase to you taking money without an agreement from your (ex?) girlfriend sounds like you both operate whimsically without effectively communicating or thinking through your course of action.

You said she sold her previous house and put all her money into this house.  How much was that?  How much did you put in?

You said you started an account with $5000.  Was that after the house was purchased?  Did each of you split all bills equally?

Why did it take a year and a half to close when it normally is like 30-60 days?  You also said you kept the down payment when I'm pretty sure you meant earnest deposit.  If the buyer backed out without a contractually agreed upon reason, you're normally allowed to keep that deposit.  Down payments go towards the mortgage to lower the amount being financed.

Don't co-own property with someone you're dating without the protection of marriage.  Legally you're just friends who both own property, and the ownership isn't clearly defined.  A court would likely just shrug and split it 50/50, or lawyers would charge you a small fortune to comb through the financials to figure out who is owed what.",2093,0,,,YTA,

>She couldn’t get a mortgage but made great money and basically put all of the $$$ down for the down payment and moving expenses. We both paid the mortgage and started a joint account for the house. I started the account and put $5000 in it and we each added the same amount each week to cover the bills and anything for the house.

Your ex put down most of the initial money to buy the house, and she ended up losing a lot in the end. Even though you paid some expenses while the house was on the market, it’s likely that her losses were far greater, especially since she fronted the down payment and covered the moving costs.

She paid 100% of downpayment, all the moving costs, and you paid none of that… but you were needed as a guarantor for the mortgage because she couldn’t qualify. 

Then she lost money because you guys sold for less than purchase… but yet you didn’t want to share her lossses. But now you have a claim on the other deal for downpayment?

I think it was stupid going into the purchase of the house without having it in writing what the details are when it came to ownership.

That being said, I would do the math

    your_fraction = <amount you put into house> / <total put into house>
    her_fraction = <amount she put into house> / <total put into house>
    amount_you_put_into_house = <total amount you've put in each month to paying the mortgage>
    amount_she_put_into_the_house = <amount she put in originally> + <total amount she has put in each month to paying the mortgage>

Then take

    amount_brought_in = <amount house sold for> + <amount of down payment from first buyer> 
    amount_spent_out = <amount spend on lawyer, real estate agent for sale of house> + <amount spent on lawyer getting the first buyer's down payment>
    amount_to_divide = amount_brought_in - amount_spent_out 
    amount_you_keep = <amount to divide> * <your fraction> + <the amount you spent on the lawyers/etc>

Now clearly, there's details there I've left out. But the point being the amount you should be keeping is a fraction of the amount available based on how much you put in. And any money spent on lawyers and the like should be paid out before even looking at that.

And, if there's any chance she will push back legally, I would sit down with a lawyer or accountant of some kind to go over those numbers and make sure they make sense.",5,0,,,ESH,

In addition to the down payment, she had to pay closing costs like title fees. When the house sold, she had to pay commission to the realtors.

AITA for taking $6,000 from the sale of a house that my girlfriend and I both owned. Me (Male 38) and my girlfriend (Female 37) bought a home together to live in with our kids. I have 1 daughters and she has 2 boys. She sold her previous house and put all of that money into buying this house with me. She couldn’t get a mortgage but made great money and basically put all of the $$$ down for the down payment and moving expenses. We both paid the mortgage and started a joint account for the house. I started the account and put $5000 in it and we each added the same amount each week to cover the bills and anything for the house. Living together was a mistake and she sent a text one day while I was at work that she talked to a realtor and she was putting the house on the market after 8 months of living there. The house sold quickly for about what we paid but not before the 1st buyer backed out. After the 1st buyer backed out she left me to pay the mortgage and utilities for the empty house. After a year and a half we were awarded the 1st buyer’s down payment of $32,000. I haven’t taken any money from the sale of the house at this point and I think $6000 would be fair. My ex thinks I should only get what I paid for the lawyer to fight for the down payment which was $2,750. I feel $6000 is fair. Like I said she put a lot of money down and even though the the house sold for a similar amount she still lost a substantial sum of money. AITA

Post,1gmqygx,"AITA for not ageeing with my boyfriend that he ""helped""?",ThrowRAbluementor,2024-11-08 19:33:41,"Today, I went to pick up eight university books. I had planned to do it alone, bringing everything I’d need to carry them home by bus. On the way, my friend mentioned how heavy the books were when she picked them up the other day and suggested I ask my boyfriend for help, since he has a car. I told her the street is busy, and he’s a medical rep, often on the go. But after her suggestion, I decided to ask him anyway.

I arrived with 30 minutes to spare, so I called him. I explained that it’d be great if he could help, but only if it was convenient for both of us, or if we could grab a beverage before or after work since I hadn’t seen him in a week. Otherwise no problem,  I was planning to do it alone anyways. He insisted on helping, so we agreed I’d call when I was ready.

Once I called, he picked me up basically from the bus stop I would wait at to take my bus and took us to a parking lot a minute away where they valet-parked his car. Half the books were in my backpack, and the rest were in a bag, so I grabbed only my phone and wallet, assuming we’d spend some time together. When I asked if I needed anything else, he told me to hurry so the valet could park the car.

We walked for a bit, and then he asked, “So, what are you going to do now?” Surprised, I said, “I thought we’d hang out, so I just brought my phone and wallet.” He replied that he had to work so I said I’d just browse some shops, since I don't have my keys to go home and study. I followed for a bit until he reached the first doctor he would visit After saying goodbye, I wandered around for a couple of hours, hoping we’d meet up afterward.

At 7, he called, saying he’d just finished work, so I suggested we go for a beverage. He said he thought it 8 and that he will continue working after all. We met at the parking lot, and he drove me home, but he didn’t come up to stay since he had gym at 9.

At this point, I was a bit sad that I didn’t get to spend much time with him and I didn'tget to study, though I wasn’t mad—just a miscommunication. We brought the books upstairs, and when we got outside again, we hugged, kissed and I told him I missed him. He replied, “But hey, I helped you!”. I didn’t respond immediately, and not wanting to sound negative, I said, “I’m just glad I got to see you a bit!.” He pressed, “Didn’t I help?” I repeated myself. He got upset and frustrated, saying my response made him feel unappreciated, and that he just wanted to help. I thanked for the effort, but he seemed hurt, said goodbye, and drove off  pretty much.

Am I the asshole for not explicitly saying he helped? I feel like it would be lying, what happened didn’t feel helpful at all. He seemed really upset, and he doesn’t often help, so I feel he might be even less inclined to in the future.

(2) He got really upset and was clearly feeling unappreciated so I was wondering if it was worth it being truthful and avoiding telling him what he wanted to hear or if I am a negative person and in that way the ""asshole"".

When you asked him for help with the books, your priority was really getting to see him, not necessarily getting help with the books (since you could do it on your own anyway). When you asked him for help with the books, his priority was to assist you with the books, not necessarily spending time with you. 

So from your point of view, he didn’t really help you because you could have done the task by yourself more efficiently, and you only asked him for help bc you wanted to hang out. From his point of view, he went out of his way to help you with these books by picking you and the books up, and now he’s confused because you’re telling him he didn’t help at all.

It sounds like he thought the main thing was to get the books from Point A to Point B without you having to carry heavy stuff on the bus. And mission accomplished.

It sounds like you thought the main thing was for the two of you to spend time together. and you’re disappointed that didn’t happen.    


Maybe he’s being dense for not understanding what you REALLY wanted rather than what you SAID you wanted, maybe it should’ve been obvious. Or maybe not, I don’t know.  But I do know from many years of experience that people who don’t communicate what they really want and then are disappointed with you even though you did exactly what they actually asked you to, and on top of that they won’t even tell you why? Those people are exhausting to deal with. Now you’re BOTH disappointed. (and “upset, frustrated, unappreciated…”)  So maybe rethink your communication style.

I also feel like there's a bit of context missing. What exactly stopped you from going back to his car, get your books and stuff and head home as soon as you realized he had to work?

While I understand it was incredibly frustrating to walk around for hours, the exchange at the end could have gone better and it just further solidifies both of you need to work on your communication with each other.

He felt he'd done what he was asked to do which was help with the books. Everything after that was unfortunate because you both misinterpreted each other and had zero to do with the initial helping.

Comment,1gmqygx,"AITA for not ageeing with my boyfriend that he ""helped""?",EnvironmentalNorth39,2024-11-09 19:19:48,"I agree with NAH, since it sounds mostly like a lack of communication. But honestly, it doesn't sound like either of you are ready to be in a relationship. He sounds WAY too busy for one (and uninterested) and you sound like you don't know how to ask for what you need or how to put yourself first (absolutely important in a relationship).


Sure, he took the time from his busy work schedule to go and help you but, couldn't he have taken 20 minutes more and have a coffee with you? And why would he make you wait around for HOURS for him instead of just taking you home? I know, because you didn't ask. Which brings us back to you not knowing how to ask for what you need, but also shows how he doesn't even TRY to understand that you have needs. Did he really think you wanted to wait for him for HOURS when he knew there was no hanging out together afterward? What was the point, how did this make sense in his mind?


Just as an extra two cents, and I'm hoping your boyfriend is not that bad, but this reminded me of an ex who told me about a job (he knew I was searching) and then also literally told me how grateful I should be with him that he found me this job, a job I decided right then to NOT take because it belonged to a friend of his, and he (my ex) expected me to pay him 30% of my earnings for the next few months because you know, he found me that job.

Why didn't he tell you that the reason he was parking his car is because he had to go back to work and it would be at least several hours? Just so you knew what you were dealing with. Maybe you would have asked if he can just keep the stuff in his car and you would take the bus home without all the heavy bucks and he could do the favor to just drop them off to you later whenever he got out of work?  Or not for nothing, he actually should have offered that without you even having to ask.  And if he wasn't looking to hang out afterwards, why didn't he say that when you brought it up? And when you said you missed him and that you wanted to spend time with him, notice that he did not respond in kind, he was just looking for the thanks about him helping you.

Today, I went to pick up eight university books. I had planned to do it alone, bringing everything I’d need to carry them home by bus. On the way, my friend mentioned how heavy the books were when she picked them up the other day and suggested I ask my boyfriend for help, since he has a car. I told her the street is busy, and he’s a medical rep, often on the go. But after her suggestion, I decided to ask him anyway.

I arrived with 30 minutes to spare, so I called him. I explained that it’d be great if he could help, but only if it was convenient for both of us, or if we could grab a beverage before or after work since I hadn’t seen him in a week. Otherwise no problem,  I was planning to do it alone anyways. He insisted on helping, so we agreed I’d call when I was ready.

Once I called, he picked me up basically from the bus stop I would wait at to take my bus and took us to a parking lot a minute away where they valet-parked his car. Half the books were in my backpack, and the rest were in a bag, so I grabbed only my phone and wallet, assuming we’d spend some time together. When I asked if I needed anything else, he told me to hurry so the valet could park the car.

We walked for a bit, and then he asked, “So, what are you going to do now?” Surprised, I said, “I thought we’d hang out, so I just brought my phone and wallet.” He replied that he had to work so I said I’d just browse some shops, since I don't have my keys to go home and study. I followed for a bit until he reached the first doctor he would visit After saying goodbye, I wandered around for a couple of hours, hoping we’d meet up afterward.

At 7, he called, saying he’d just finished work, so I suggested we go for a beverage. He said he thought it 8 and that he will continue working after all. We met at the parking lot, and he drove me home, but he didn’t come up to stay since he had gym at 9.

At this point, I was a bit sad that I didn’t get to spend much time with him and I didn'tget to study, though I wasn’t mad—just a miscommunication. We brought the books upstairs, and when we got outside again, we hugged, kissed and I told him I missed him. He replied, “But hey, I helped you!”. I didn’t respond immediately, and not wanting to sound negative, I said, “I’m just glad I got to see you a bit!.” He pressed, “Didn’t I help?” I repeated myself. He got upset and frustrated, saying my response made him feel unappreciated, and that he just wanted to help. I thanked for the effort, but he seemed hurt, said goodbye, and drove off  pretty much.

Am I the asshole for not explicitly saying he helped? I feel like it would be lying, what happened didn’t feel helpful at all. He seemed really upset, and he doesn’t often help, so I feel he might be even less inclined to in the future.

While, yes, there was obviously some MASSIVE miscommunication going on between the two of you, he did not help in any way, shape, or form.  In point of fact, he HINDERED you in your task, costing you hours of time.


So, no, you aren't an asshole for not lying to him to boost his ego when he insisted that he was helpful and told you to agree with his fantasy of being a helpful boyfriend.  In fact, your restraint in just refusing to tell him what a good Boi he was rather than confronting him on his shittiness was laudable.

Post,1gmm85u,AITA? Yelled at a guy in the parking lot,Affectionate-Flan-99,2024-11-08 16:14:50,"Here’s a relatively tame story compared to some of the wild things I’ve seen on here.

This morning around 6:45, I stopped by my local grocery store to grab some food before work. The parking spaces there are angled, making it easy to pull in, but they do follow a one-way traffic flow. I went up one lane and pulled through a space so my car’s nose was facing the driving lane—technically facing the 'wrong' direction. Since it was so early and the lot was practically empty, with literally hundreds of open spots, I figured it wouldn’t be an issue.

As soon as I parked, though, I looked up to see a guy pull up nose-to-nose with my car. He started gesturing for me to back up and let him have the space, despite there being two open spots to my left and right. I just looked at him and shook my head slowly. He then reversed, parked in the space to my left, rolled down his window, and shouted, 'What the fuck are you doing, dumbass? You’re parked the wrong way!' I replied, 'Fuck you boomer there are 10,000 open parking spaces. You don't need this one that badly!'

He got out, threw one final 'Fuck you' my way, to which I replied with 'Eat my asshole, old man!' and we both went inside, in opposite directions.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole here?

EDIT: Just so this is clear, because based on some comments it may not be. I was very obviously in the spot well before him. I didn’t like cut him off as he was going to it. The car was parked before he even pointed the nose of his car at mine. I beat him there by at least five seconds. He saw me in the ‘wrong’ place to park and wanted to start a feud. 

2nd EDIT: The lot is not clearly marked as a one way. It’s just an unwritten rule that the slanted parking spots are supposed to be going one direction. People go the opposite way all the time. Not to mention I would definitely have gone (and did) the right direction when leaving 

EDIT 3: Anyone saying I’m the asshole for how I parked and not for telling the old fart to fuck off is insane. ",277,322,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gmm85u/aita_yelled_at_a_guy_in_the_parking_lot/,"The final verdict is: **Everyone Sucks**

Here’s a relatively tame story compared to some of the wild things I’ve seen on here.

This morning around 6:45, I stopped by my local grocery store to grab some food before work. The parking spaces there are angled, making it easy to pull in, but they do follow a one-way traffic flow. I went up one lane and pulled through a space so my car’s nose was facing the driving lane—technically facing the 'wrong' direction. Since it was so early and the lot was practically empty, with literally hundreds of open spots, I figured it wouldn’t be an issue.

As soon as I parked, though, I looked up to see a guy pull up nose-to-nose with my car. He started gesturing for me to back up and let him have the space, despite there being two open spots to my left and right. I just looked at him and shook my head slowly. He then reversed, parked in the space to my left, rolled down his window, and shouted, 'What the fuck are you doing, dumbass? You’re parked the wrong way!' I replied, 'Fuck you boomer there are 10,000 open parking spaces. You don't need this one that badly!'

He got out, threw one final 'Fuck you' my way, to which I replied with 'Eat my asshole, old man!' and we both went inside, in opposite directions.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole here?""

I realize that is something my dad always said to her so I understand why she was upset but at the same time if you are intentionally doing something to annoy me why should I put up with it in my car. AITA?

Post,1gm4dav,AITA for calling my mom “unreliable”.,Greed1ng,2024-11-07 23:26:27,"I’m 16 years old and I needed a foam mat for a science project. The only problem is these are not near or house and at a store 30 minutes away. I don’t got a license so I told my mom before I went to school to buy it for me. Just to make sure she did, I even sent her messages during school to get it which she agreed to. When I got home (Tuesday), I discovered that she completely forgot about it and said that she was too tired to drive to the store right now. I was slightly nervous because the project is due Friday but it wasn’t too big of a deal because I was sure I could do it in that time. So, I told her to buy it tomorrow (Wednesday) and sent her a message during school again to buy it. When I got home, she was chatting with friends she invited over. So I reminded her if she got it and her reply was no, so I asked if we could go right now but she said no because her friends are here. At this point, I was irritated but didn’t push it and just made her promise she’d get it tomorrow. Eventually, her friends did leave around 7 but i was already deep into my homework by then and didn’t get to bed until 11. So today rolls around, and I told her she must absolutely get it now as the project is due tomorrow. She confirms and says she got it but when I got home, she didn’t have the dang thing. I was irritated at this point and just remarked that even with all my reminders that she still proves to be unreliable. She got mad and started screaming at me calling me ungrateful and critical of her mistakes. So now I’m in the car with my friend going to that store because my mom refused to take me after I said that to her.

All parents will forget important things like this at least once in their lives, but a good, reliable parent will actually get it on day 2, even if it means they have to say goodbye to their friend early, because at this point they recognize that they’ve had 3 missed opportunities (Tuesday day, Tuesday evening, and Wednesday day) and it just needs to get done so their kid can get their school project done.  I know mine might have asked Tuesday night if I needed them to go get it despite their fatigue or if it could wait until the next day, but they’d have gotten it without fail on Wednesday.

Comment,1gm4dav,AITA for calling my mom “unreliable”.,Fluffy_Examination63,2024-11-12 09:08:36,"NTA. Asking versus telling wouldn't have made a difference. When a child is made to be the parent in that family dynamic, they'll act like an average parent and tell the actual parent what they need to do. S/he probably spent 16 years with the mom and probably learned that the mom was unreliable early on & that the kid needed to take on parent responsibilities, which includes telling the mom what to do to meet the child's needs.


Ordering from Amazon comments are absolutely ridiculous. OP most likely didn't have access to that option. People here are saying ""Duh, Amazon"", but what if the financial situation in the household is such that there was no Amazon account and credit card for such an account? If the mom is unreliable at home, imagine her at her workplace, imagine her state of finances, can someone that unreliable work a job that pays a living wage or even has the ability to keep a credit card, if she even could get one?


OP is in a bind. Apparently, it was a BIG ASK to have the friend's parent take him/her, otherwise the OP, knowing how their mom operates having grown up with the mom, would've asked the friend's parent first.


I think all the harshness against OP in this thread is because assumptions about the OP were made based on the grammatical error of ""don't got a license"". All people will make grammatical errors in posts eventually. Reddit is not an English class, it's a place where sometimes anguished people seek out help because they're struggling.


OP, I'm pretty sure you're playing the role as parent in this household, so you have two years to prepare for independence from such an unreliable parent. In those two years, you'll need to work your butt off on top of school stuff to save to buy a car. Whatever money you make at jobs you eventually get, save every last penny for the car and to rent a room or share an apartment. Don't let your mom tap into the funds, especially if she's irresponsible with her own money. Also, get a hold of your birth certificate and social security card as soon as you can so your mom doesn't keep it to force you to stay with her after you turn 18. Best of luck in school and in life. Work smart in every aspect of your life; take calculated risks; learn how to network with people to keep getting better jobs; eventually seek therapy to deal with the family issues to become a better parent to your kids than your mom is with you, and you will succeed in life. Again, best of luck. You got this!!!",5,0,,,NTA,

Your mom doesn't sound very organized, but it sounds like you are continuing to rely on her when you know she has a habit of not not following through.

Yes, your mother was unquestionably an AH for not keeping her word, and for leaving you in the lurch with a school project. As a parent, she really let you down, and that's absolutely an AH way to behave. 

But . . .

You seem unspeakably rude. I know plenty of wonderful, loving, supportive moms, and *not a single one of them* would have agreed to get the foam board in the first place for their teenagers if they spoke to them the way you do to your mother, with your ""I told my mom to get it"" and ""I told her to buy it tomorrow"". If their kids tried to tell them what to do instead of asking nicely (because you were, in fact, asking her for a favour that cost her money, and significant time, and effort), they'd be told, ""I'll consider it, when you learn to speak to me like a human being and not your personal assistant,"" or something similar. And rightly so.

So yes, you're an AH too. Maybe learn not to boss people around when you're asking them to extend themselves for you. If I were your mum, I wouldn't be particularly inclined to hurry up and help you either, given how rude you were.",8,0,,,ESH,

Comment,1gm4dav,AITA for calling my mom “unreliable”.,pickledpl_um,2024-11-08 02:47:09,"Hey OP. Respectfully, reading between the lines, it sounds like you were able to get this done yourself and instead put the burden on your mom. The fact that you say you repeatedly told her to get it (not asked) and that you only wanted to go get it when it was convenient for you (as you said you were ""deep in your homework"" when her friends left and she was free to take you to the store) give that impression. 

Now, you are 16, so independence is relatively new and probably still somewhat restricted, but I think you need to take on some responsibility here. It's your project, not your mother's. It's your grade, not your mother's. You're 16, not 6. You're old enough to drive or you have friends who drive, but you didn't take any steps to get the foam board, other than hammering your mother regularly to do it for you. You didn't walk there, you didn't get an Uber, you didn't order it on a delivery app, you didn't just move ahead and repurpose an old foam board or tape together some pieces of posterboard or even printer paper. You had a lot of options other than what you chose to do. 

I know you don't want to hear this, but you contributed to the situation quite a bit. Your mother should not have screamed at you, end of sentence. You should have been kinder to her and more proactive about getting the foam board. These are small tasks you can take on on your own now that will help you establish some independence, problem-solving skills, and also help heal your relationship with your mom as you not leaning on her so much will let the two of you give each other a little space and grace.

Post,1glbyny,AITA for disinviintg my daughter to Thanksgiving when she won't host Thanksgiving?,BonusSpecialist1607,2024-11-06 23:07:58,"Throwaway 

In our family, holidays are rotated, so one person hosts the Fourth of July, another hosts Christmas, and another hosts Thanksgiving etc.. This way, no one is constantly hosting, and it makes it fair for everyone. This post is about my middle daughter, Clara. Clara has always been skipping her host duties, when it gets to her she has an excuse why she can't host. It ranges but usually goes along the lines of stress or she is too busy. 

This results in other family members to pick up her holiday. It is frustrating and multiple people have talked to her about this. She bailed on hosting Easter but promised me that she would do Thanksgiving we swapped holidays. At the time I made it very clear she needed to stay true to her word and if she dumped it on someone else she wouldn't be going to Thanksgiving. It usually gets dumped on me.

Anyway, I called her asking if she wanted me to bring a dessert board for Thanksgiving. She told me that she could not host because she had just moved into her home (she moved in July), and it was too messy to host. I told her she could clean since it was a few weeks away. She told me she can't. 

I know the other kids can't host it, (well one could but she is doing Christmas and its not fair at all for her). I informed everyone it would beat my place this year. I also informed everyone that Clara is not invited this year to Thanksgiving.

Clara was pissed when I told her that and we got into a huge argument. She thinks I am a big jerk. My other kids are split, two of them are happy since they are tired of picking up her slack when this happens while others things this is too far.

Comment,1glbyny,AITA for disinviintg my daughter to Thanksgiving when she won't host Thanksgiving?,HopingForAWhippet,2024-11-06 23:32:24,"Edit: after seeing OP’s response, NTA.

I N F O: have you ever had a conversation about coming to a compromise, or seeing why Clara is so adamant about not hosting? For example, do the rest of you have spouses that can help while Clara is single? Does she have small children while the rest don’t? Or maybe Clara just has the personality where hosting is rough on her.

If I were you, I’d have this honest conversation and see what middle ground can be reached. For example, in my family, my parents always host for holidays because they have the biggest nicest home, and because they live near other people they’d like to invite. But my sister and I often go over a few days early, do the cleaning, shopping, and cooking, and make things as easy on my parents as possible. And when there are outside guests, we take on hosting duties as well.

I’m just surprised that you’d jump to ostracizing Clara from the holidays without figuring out a way for her to contribute without hosting. If she’s only willing to take in all aspects that’s one issue. If the only thing she’s not willing to give is hosting, though, if you love her and want to spend time with her, wouldn’t you want to at least try and figure something out?",7933,0,,,NTA,

My sister hates hosting people in her space and I’d never want to make her do it just because it’s what is seen as fair. On the other hand, my brother and sister in law love hosting people and parties at their house. They usually do Christmas, Halloween, Easter and have everyone over. 

I usually do Thanksgiving and New Years, and our parents will usually do like 4th of July, Labor and Memorial Day (they have a pool). It just kind of worked out that everyone picked holidays that play to their strengths and my sister has been to every single event and will always offer to help set up/clean/bring things in lieu of official host duties. 

I couldn’t imagine forcing her to take on duties that she hates and makes her miserable or tell her to not come to our parties, because I love her. Sure, I get stressed hosting too, but I’d rather have my sister to celebrate with then alienate her and still have to pick up slack.

Clara is an AH for constantly promising to do something and then pulling out at the last minute. Hosting is exhausting and it usually costs you in both money and time. It’s fair enough that some people don’t enjoy it, however you can’t continue to reap the benefits from everyone else whilst giving nothing in return and expect to keep being invited. 

If she knows she doesn’t want to host and never will, she should be upfront and offer to cover costs and help set up/ clean up someone else’s place. Or have her year at a venue (even a park), so then no one is in her house.

I would resent being prodded to do it. I do not want more than a couple of people in my house at a time and only for, at most, an hour. I cook a few things but have had enough complaints (too spicy, not enough something, ingredients they don’t like, even my own faves do not always suit others, not cooked enough or too much, etc, etc.) that I am burnt. Criticism makes me shut down. Any social event is hard for me, my energy drains rapidly. 

I also do not bring anything other than wine or champagne to parties given by others.  Again, past criticism makes me reluctant to try anything else. I help clean up, particularly if it gets me away from the socializing. 

I don’t know what’s going on with Clara. Maybe she’s autistic or ADHD and has not realized it yet. Maybe it’s social anxiety. Maybe she doesn’t like domestic stuff at all, not cooking, not cleaning, and just barely gets it done for herself and only sometimes.  Maybe she hasn’t been able to figure out even to herself what exactly she hates about the hosting or even social activities. Maybe you or other family members treat her badly.  Do all of the others nag her or is it just you? And maybe she has not been able to communicate it to you because you are too insistent on your grievances to hear her. 

Your family is weird and mean, to my eyes. And far too insistent on big family events and duties for my tastes. Just yikes. (And I do like my family in small doses.) I get that you are annoyed but maybe you could try to find out why she balks by asking why and not interrupting or complaining as she tries to explain. Somehow I think you don’t listen.  

It might help to read up about neurodivergent issues, just in case that’s what’s going on, because neurotypicals have a very hard time understanding so a bit of info might be useful. There are a lot of vids on You Tube where autistic and ADHD people try to explain how they are. Maybe some of these will look familiar to you. Or her. Dunno. 

I do think you might, if you are kind and careful, negotiate an agreement that she stops agreeing to host and backs out late. (I bet she agrees because she imagines that next time she will feel up to it and, as it draws closer, she just can’t. I am projecting.) Just accept, maybe, that she’s not going to host or cook. And agree that when she comes to other events, she brings wine or a dessert from the bakery or helps clean after. Or something specific and not hard. And maybe she may, at some point, want to try something smaller.  Again with the projection, but if she does, do not be critical. Or maybe you just don’t like her. You act like you only like your kids if they do what you want. I could be wrong.

I cannot imagine a family that makes people host. How insensitive and intrusive. It’s what you do because it’s the dynamic YOU set up. Sounds like she never agreed to it. There are so many barriers as to why someone might not want to host or doesn’t feel able - work (different stresses), finances, comfort in own space, comfort having others in their space, comfort around others (as a guest she can leave), etc etc etc. so many physical, emotional and financial variables.  


 But mostly I cannot imagine forcing someone to host. It’s a privilege for people that want to. Maybe she never signed up for this and was voluntold and that’s the dynamic you created. Then you’re kicking your DAUGHTER out of family functions?? Also, it’s a bit much to get together for every freaking holiday - Easter, Fourth of July. I dated someone like this and it was always about their family dynamic - yes rotated houses - and it was exhausting and no space or room for people to go to outside families.  You sound pushy AND cruel because it’s not what YOU want. How do you even get off forcing someone to host if they want to be included in the family dynamic? 


 If you want to know how we do it, we either say “who wants to host this year? Are we getting together for this?” Half the time we’re saying “ok, if you get to do this year then next year is at mine”. Nobody is forcing anyone. And there’s always compromise - “you can’t come on this date bc of your spouses family? Ok, we’ll do this date instead. Does that work for everyone?” As long as everyone gets prioritized in SOME way - it’s about spending time together and enjoying each other’s company.

Additionally, assuming this person is an adult who holds down a job, they have to have SOME level of communication skills.

He will often start talking about a topic he's interested in and keep monologuing about it for like 10 minutes. However, he will do it without caring if I'm listening to him or not, whether I'm reacting to the things he's saying or not, he will just lead a monologue whose purpose doesn't seem to be anything else than to lecture me and show me how stupid I am.

As you can perhaps understand, I'm quite annoyed by this, but don't know how to handle it. A few weeks ago he was lecturing me about car engines (I literally can't even drive) and I tried just straight up telling him ""hey, I'm not really interested in this"" and he got offended and then started telling me ""I'm not interested in this"" every time I tried to share a piece of info (even if it was relevant to him!) with him.

This morning, I had trouble with my internet (I was supposed to work from home) and asked him about it. He helped me, but then started explaining the issues with my VPN and how VPNs work. I tuned out after a bit, because I couldn't understand a word of what he was saying, and started checking my mails. Then he got offended again because I was ignoring him. I told him that I really don't like it when he lectures me and that I would like him to stop doing it, he told me that he doesn't feel like he's lecturing me. In the end I kinda mockingly asked him, whether he would prefer me to just stare at him, until he gets it out of his system, since I apparently can't even tell him, when I'm not interested in something. He got offended again and the atmosphere at home was so tense, I decided to go to the office instead.

Tell him he’s intelligent and he likes to share his wisdom, but it doesn’t resonate with you the same way the information does with him. It can feel like a lecture, and at that point, it doesn’t feel like a conversation between equals or partners. 

I don’t think you brought it up in the healthiest way, and he sure as hell didn’t respond in the healthiest way, but idk if that makes anyone an asshole. Just try to avoid letting your feelings bubble up like that and look for a kinder avenue to communicate.


ETA: My thought process here is to give him the benefit of the doubt. Once. For the sake of the relationship, talk it out as though he didn’t mean to make OP feel stupid or bore OP to death. Give him a chance to change his behaviour.

Your partner may be on some sort of autism spectrum and he might not even know this. 

My husband is like your partner. He talks about things the same way your BF seems to talk. It used to annoy the crap out of me. He would even carry on talking if I left the room, or went into another room to get something etc. He also listens to a lot of podcasts, videos etc. 

There are a lot of things he talks about that I am NOT interested in. And at the beginning I used to tell him that I don’t want to listen to it or that it feels like lecture. He would get annoyed and upset. What I realised after a course I attended that some people who had some sort of childhood trauma as a kid, especially if they were ignored or simply told to shut up, these people as adults want to talk, they want to be listened to. I also learned that some people, who are intelligent and smart are usually on some sort of autism spectrum and their ‘talking’ behaviour is very different to others. 

What I started doing is engaging in the conversation but if I wasn’t interested in it I would suggest that he sends me a link to a podcast or a video I could listen to later on and then move the conversation onto something else. Or I would listen to what he has to say but gently say something like ‘Do you know what? I don’t find it interesting’ or ‘Do you mind if we talk about something else? This isn’t for me’. 

I needed to learn to let him speak and actually have a conversation with me about whatever it was he wanted to talk about, regardless whether it interests me or not. But at the same time I also needed to teach him that I don’t always want to talk about stuff and maybe he can just listen to something instead.

You don’t say how long you’ve been together so you didn’t give us any clues to whether or not you want to make this work. If yes, are there things you love to explain and explore and is that something you’d want to share or explore together? If yes, the two of you could discuss how you take turns.

As an autistic person who's definitely info dumped on people, it's important to know when to reel that in so you're not taking over a conversation.

I don't know if your BF is on the spectrum. But how he's reacting to this isn't cool. I suggest having a conversation when you two aren't frustrated with each other about this. 

That said, there's nothing wrong with listening to a topic you don't care about for a small amount of time if it's important to someone you love.

Tell him that sometimes you will be open to listen, but not all the time. Tell him sometimes you'll want to hear about a subject, but not every subject.

Before he starts a monologue, make it a requirement that he ask if you have the mental bandwidth to listen and to state the general subject first to see if you can stomach it.

If you say you don't have the time, then maybe you can negotiate for later. If you don't have the interest, then he needs to find someone else to monologue to.

I would also state your time limit for a monologue at the very beginning and stick to it.

If he cannot appreciate your boundaries, then you don't need to entertain him at all. 🤷‍♀️",2,0,,,,

From everything you're explaining he just like info dumping. He's not talking down to you, he just starts talking about something he's passionate about and doesn't stop.

He might just be neurodivergent, some of them do this because they're into the topic and/or think it'll be helpful or interesting because it us to them. And it's difficult for them to stop and recognize whether someone is into it or not. 

It's totally valid to be annoyed or not wanna be info dumped at but it seems like your insecurities are making you take it maliciously. He's not upset you don't let hin lecture you. He's in the dumps you basically say you don't care when he's sharing things he's passionate about.

Your boyfriend has no respect for you and thinks you're an idiot. 

Your comment stated that he knows when you tune him out and he even states that you're not listening and you confirm you're not listening because you're not interested. 

Ignore the commenter saying he's oblivious because clearly he's not since he can notice when you tune out. 

Ignore the commenter saying that he just wants to share information because clearly he doesn't since he doesn't care if you're interested in the information or not. 

Ignore the commenters stating you need to coddle him and tell him nicely because men get put on a pedestal enough and this is why they get to do this shitty behavior because they're really bluntly towed to stop it. Notice how your boyfriend freaked out when simply told to stop it. 

You can choose to continue this relationship with a man who has no respect for you, will continue to do and say things you have no interest in, and expect you to kiss his ass but that seems like a pretty miserable setup to me. But I know plenty of women who take worse men because they can't fathom not being some guys girlfriend.

But if you think you're going to continue this relationship with him I just want you to stop and think with this guy still be with you if you stop sucking his dick, didn't have as much sex as he want to, or gained any weight. Because you're willing to put up with his condescending lectures, him breaking boundaries, and him showing absolutely no respect for you and in exchange you get a dude that would likely dump your ass when you gain weight or stop sucking his dick.",5,0,,,NTA,

>However, he will do it without caring if I'm listening to him or not, whether I'm reacting to the things he's saying or not, he will just lead a monologue whose purpose doesn't seem to be anything else than to lecture me and show me how stupid I am.


Okay, couple of questions 

1)does he do this only to you or everyone? 

2) is he diagnosed with adhd or ASD, or is it possible he has adhd or ASD? 

(infodumping is how adhders and ASDers connect with others. If he is ND he'd do this with anyone he liked and trusted. If he's lecturing out of misogyny or something, it will be limited to women (or if he were racist, POC etc) . Biggest indicator of which it is is who it happens with. Same as anger management issue VS abusers. People with actual anger management issues will blow up at bosses, authority figures, etc if triggered. It's a loss of control over oneself. Abusers will pick and choose to only blow up where it can't harm their reputation, meaning they haven't actually lost control. Same principle. When and towards whom does the behavior happen? )

>As you can perhaps understand, I'm quite annoyed by this, but don't know how to handle it. A few weeks ago he was lecturing me about car engines (I literally can't even drive) and I tried just straight up telling him ""hey, I'm not really interested in this"" and he got offended and then started telling me ""I'm not interested in this"" every time I tried to share a piece of info (even if it was relevant to him!) with him.

That's childish AF, tbh. I'd be so mad I wouldn't bother talking about it or telling him anything he needs to know for a few days. He can mange his responsibilities himself if that's ho he reacts. What is he, 5?

>Then he got offended again because I was ignoring him. I told him that I really don't like it when he lectures me and that I would like him to stop doing it,

Setting a boundary should have been enough. Look, I'm dxed Auadhd and I infodump for fun, but i don't do it with allistics. (I also don't do small talk coz I get nothing out of that allistic bid for connection, just like allistics don't get anything out of my infodumping) 

>In the end I kinda mockingly asked him, whether he would prefer me to just stare at him, until he gets it out of his system, since I apparently can't even tell him, when I'm not interested in something

A bit mean, but honestly understandable if you've tied to bring it up before and he behaved like a 5 year old afterwards. (allistic or autistic, I wouldn't tolerate that behaviour from a partner, personally) 

>He got offended again and the atmosphere at home was so tense, I decided to go to the office instead.

Does tha happen often? That he makes the atmosphere tense enough that you don't want to be in your own home?",4,0,,,NTA,

Me (F24) and my boyfriend (M25) are at odds and I need some more opinions. I recently went out drinking with a group of girls and crashed at one’s house, in her bed, which my bf really did not like because he has never met her. I am pan sexual but in no way shape or form was it a sexual encounter what so ever. Also, it is not the first time I’ve shared a bed with another woman while in the relationship but he’s really mad because he doesn’t know her. I posted a picture from that night onto my story for my October photo dump and he has once again brought up how much it hurt him and that I’m being inconsiderate about his feelings. I can understand where he’s coming from but I feel like he’s making it a bigger deal than it is. So am I the asshole or is he being dramatic?

You need to discuss boundaries. That’s okay. 


You were playing by the rules and following precedent. Maybe he’s been stuffing down his real feelings about these sleeping arrangements but was trying to be cool about it. It’s not a crime for him to change his mind or finally acknowledge feelings. 

Seems like you weren’t trying to hurt him or flaunt your freedom. More that you’re confused as to why there’s an issue *now*. As a 31yo heterosexual cis-female I’ve slept in the same bed as heterosexual and bisexual cis-females for basically all my life, while single or partnered. And a couple of hetero cis-men, platonically. (But those were outliers lol.) So I get it. This isn’t a universal practice and not everyone will be comfortable with it. Sure, you can be more sensitive but that’s a forgivable offense. 

There’s still time to rectify the situation. Renegotiate boundaries. Expect him to express some hurt feelings from the past. Be open to adapting your behaviors. Express your desire to understand and make things better. This is totally fixable. He’s not an AH for being hurt by these actions, and you’re not an AH for being confused by a different set of rules.",2,0,,,NAH,

I understand you and your dad's thought process, but asking you to slip money into his wallet was not the way to do it. It's overstepping and disrespectful.

First off, you shouldn't be involved AT ALL.  Your dad wants to compensate your boyfriend for tutoring, and your boyfriend feels like he's repaying a debt to your dad for saving his dad's life (or at least giving him health back).  You are not respecting that, and over involving yourself.  Also, don't go through his wallet.

Your dad can thank him and pay him, certainly. Normally, a good way to do this is to give him a card with a gift card in it. (Not sure where you are, or if that's possible).",29,0,,,YTA,

My(21f) dad gave one of his kidneys to his best friend, who is my boyfriend(25)’s dad. This happened several years ago. 

Recently, my boyfriend started tutoring my younger brother(13) in ESL(English as a Second Language). For context, my boyfriend taught me English and his English is still much better than mine.

The family background is why my boyfriend declined payment for teaching my brother. My dad still felt uncomfortable letting him tutor my brother for free, even though my boyfriend insisted it’s the least he could do.

So he asked me to slip the money into my boyfriend’s wallet when he isn’t looking(when he’s in the bathroom etc). 

My boyfriend didn’t notice for a couple of weeks but ended up realizing he had more cash than he ought to. I told him what I did and he said I shouldn’t have done it, knowing how he feels about the subject.

Sometimes, accepting a small gift of gratitude from someone you were kind to is another act of kindness. If they feel indebted, it can weigh on them, and they may hesitate to ask for help again.

Perhaps if you explain this is how your dad seems to feel, he might be willing to find a happy medium. Lots of people would feel terribly uncomfortable about receiving money as a gift of thanks. But something like your dad taking your boyfriend out for lunch once in awhile, or helping him out with an errand, would be a good way for your dad to feel the slate is clean, your boyfriend's to feel that this is less transactional.

I've helped my sister with setting up her new apartment, and moving some furniture. I would not be comfortable with her giving me money for that. But I didn't mind that she instead bought me some bubble tea, and had me over for dinner and a movie. I felt good that I helped her, and I felt good that I could spend some time with her.

""That my boyfriend shouldn’t feel indebted about it since my dad was more than happy and is still happy about the decision.""

Unfortunately, no matter how much GOOD one can do, there will be those who do good and cannot do good for profit. it violates the moral code and ethic of being good or doing the right thing for the sake of doing the right thing.

I can relate to your BF, as it is MENTALLY PAINFUL to accept money for doing something I DO NOT WANT TO BE PAID FOR. its really as simple as that. I would much, much rather someone say hey dude, thanks for helping. let me buy you lunch. (which is the proposed solution. a  good one i agree with!)

  
You did nothing wrong, i just hope you can understand that FORCING someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries. Even if its silly, and you know he could use the money(not sure if this is the case, more of an example), forcing someone to do something is disrespectful to their ideals. Again, i don't feel you did this with intent, i think you where just trying to do the right thing. 

Also, if your dads saved his dads life, he might be doing this not out of obligation or duty to repay a familial debt, but because he feels its the least he can to do show his gratitude.

For example, if his sole purpose of teaching your brother is some kind of deep seated duty to repay your family for the act of kindness your family blessed his with, you forcing him to accept money he doesn't want is equivalent of him teaching your brother to repay a debt.

In this case, there is no debt(at least from the vibes i get coming from the dads)

Obviously the not accepting no for an answer. If your dad wasn't okay with the ""price"" of services ($0), then he can terminate the tutoring. 


But there are two additional issues. You went through his wallet. Not cool. 


And, I dont know your boyfriend's financial position, but some people are really precise with the amount of money they have.

Post,1gkhp7b,AITA for telling my friends I don't want to rent with them the night they're trying to sign a lease?,sylnium,2024-11-05 21:21:28,"Hello. I am a 19 year old first-year college student, who about a week ago, agreed with a group of 5 friends that I'd be interested in living with them next school year. 

Yesterday, we found a place we really liked and talked about how we'd figure out the lease by the end of the week. Today they've decided they want to sign the lease ASAP/by tonight because the landlord explained that the market is competitive and they don't want to lose this nice house... But, reading through the lease has made me realize I don't want to do this financially. 

Even with the 5 of us, this would cost me $750/month or $9k to live there for august 2025-july 2026, not counting utilities... and that is money that could go towards classes (I am paying for school by myself and just came back from a gap year of working. I do not want to take any loans and have a lot of anxieties about going into debt after college because it happened to mom and it still effects her). My family also lives close enough to campus that I can just stay with them without having to pay anything.  

These friends are all from out of town so they need to find a place to stay. I feel like a dick now for saying I don't think I can as soon as they are trying to sign the place, because I definitely could with the money I have saved, but I know I'll regret it in the future. I know I really don't want to, but feel like I have to because they don't have anyone else and they need 5 people.

Right now I am banking on the fact that my parents refuse to co-sign, but I technically wouldn't need them because my credit score is better than the both of them. Do I continue to lie and say that my parents are the reason I can't sign? Most if not all of these places require us to have co-signers because we're so young, but my parents' financial history are so poor they don't think they'd be approved as co-signers

I feel like an asshole because this is causing them a lot of anxiety, but it would be better for my own anxiety in the long run if I stayed at home and saved the money... I don't know how any of them are paying for school, so I feel awkward and kind of like an asshole for suddenly saying I couldn't afford it.

(How would you/should I go about this without ruining my relationship with these people? I don't want to screw them over but know I will if I pull out, which is what I want to do...)",62,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gkhp7b/aita_for_telling_my_friends_i_dont_want_to_rent/,"The final verdict is: **Asshole**

Based on my understanding, it’s not that you no longer want to room with them but the place is out of your budget/an amount you’re willing to pay. Thats absolutely fine but you NEED to communicate that. 

A “hey guys, that price point is out of my budget. If you want to live there that’s totally fine but you’ll need to find another roommate. I can’t make that work will sound much better than the lie you’re about to tell. They may be mad but you’ll have been honest. 

If you already told the Mommy and Daddy said no lie then it’s already over, but then just do better next time. And just live at home all four years then.

Social - Living with 5 others would be an absolute nightmare. How are you going to decide who pays what (big room/ensuite/small room)? 

what's going to happen when one inevitably moves a partner in and doesn't pay their share/makes everyone uncomfortable with couple life in a share house? Or wants to move out when they get a gf/bf and you are all dependant on them paying their share to simply afford the rent and they refuse/are adamant that they are moving out?

What about groceries - all buying separately? 5 fridges or shared? What if there are some big eaters/vegans/vegos/people who use brand name stuff and replace with home brand?

Toiletries and cleaning is expensive and some will want branded some want cheap. Utilities - some people will take 30 min showers and run up your bills. Are you okay with that?

What about the inevitable fights over weekend parties/guests when others want quiet time?  What about study days? Do you have the right to say no guests? How are household issues to be worked out? 

What if someone loses their job and can't afford rent? (you said everyone's dependant on everyone else financially so sounds like a financial balancing act at best and a dumpster fire at worst)? 

Legal - If someone leaves and doesn't pay their share or defaults on the lease, it will affect ALL of your credit ratings as your names are all on there. 

My advice is high tail it out of that situation asap - use your parents as an excuse to save face - your parents wont mind. Thats what theyre for - I'mhappy for my kids to use me as an excuse for anything if it it a situation they feel they need an excuse (within reason of course).

Be upfront with them, tell them your parents can’t cosign but also that you think they should take their time to find the best place possible. Maybe everyone needs to sit down and talk budget?

rushing into signing without having all the necessary discussions first should be expected to lead to people not agreeing to sign. And: YOu did not agree to sign, you agreed to consider it.

Be honest with them that after crunching the numbers and having a long think about it you have changed your mind.

Lying will only come back to bite you in the end.

Don't make yourself worse off financially to appease your friends. I doubt they will be the ones that bail you out financially when you get yourself into financial trouble down the road.

If you have your parents place to live it makes sense to save your money and stay there over overstretching yourself and your budget.

Will they be annoyed, maybe but they can also find another person or find a place more suited to their budget. no idea where you live but $750 a month x 5 people seems like a very expensive rental and sounds like some young people are setting themselves up to be living beyond their means.

Hello. I am a 19 year old first-year college student, who about a week ago, agreed with a group of 5 friends that I'd be interested in living with them next school year. 

Yesterday, we found a place we really liked and talked about how we'd figure out the lease by the end of the week. Today they've decided they want to sign the lease ASAP/by tonight because the landlord explained that the market is competitive and they don't want to lose this nice house... But, reading through the lease has made me realize I don't want to do this financially. 

Even with the 5 of us, this would cost me $750/month or $9k to live there for august 2025-july 2026, not counting utilities... and that is money that could go towards classes (I am paying for school by myself and just came back from a gap year of working. I do not want to take any loans and have a lot of anxieties about going into debt after college because it happened to mom and it still effects her). My family also lives close enough to campus that I can just stay with them without having to pay anything.  

These friends are all from out of town so they need to find a place to stay. I feel like a dick now for saying I don't think I can as soon as they are trying to sign the place, because I definitely could with the money I have saved, but I know I'll regret it in the future. I know I really don't want to, but feel like I have to because they don't have anyone else and they need 5 people.

Right now I am banking on the fact that my parents refuse to co-sign, but I technically wouldn't need them because my credit score is better than the both of them. Do I continue to lie and say that my parents are the reason I can't sign? Most if not all of these places require us to have co-signers because we're so young, but my parents' financial history are so poor they don't think they'd be approved as co-signers

I feel like an asshole because this is causing them a lot of anxiety, but it would be better for my own anxiety in the long run if I stayed at home and saved the money... I don't know how any of them are paying for school, so I feel awkward and kind of like an asshole for suddenly saying I couldn't afford it.

(How would you/should I go about this without ruining my relationship with these people? I don't want to screw them over but know I will if I pull out, which is what I want to do...)

Comment,1gkhp7b,AITA for telling my friends I don't want to rent with them the night they're trying to sign a lease?,AroundHFOutHF,2024-11-06 01:14:19,"OP -  Additional facts need to be considered. You will disappoint your friends, but you have learned a valuable lesson i.e. always review carefully all financial transactions before committing.

You hastily agreed to something before thinking it through. Understandable, because you are young and just beginning the journey of facing adult decisions.  You are also being rushed. Your instinct to pause is good.

1). Your parents refused to co-sign. Period.

The reason they cannot co-sign is no one's business. Why would you discuss your parents' finances, whether good or bad, with your friends? 

2) The fact that you have savings doesn't mean you owe it to others.

3) The lease doesn't start until 10 months from now. It nay be standard in your area to commit nearly a year in advance, but ... The Landlord may be rushing because you are all young and may not understand the need to CAREFULLY READ the entire lease. 

Is the liability ""several"", ""joint"", ""several and joint"". Is each signatory (tenant and tenant's parents) liable for the entire lease, meaning the Landlord can sue one family for the full amount due, leaving that family to go after everyone else? Over the next year, someone may have to drop out and the rest may be responsible. 

Some Landlords will agree that each tenant is only responsible for their share, but the Landlord will reserve the right to add another renter of their choosing. In college towns, there may be a decent flow of students to ""plug and play"". This can be agreeable amongst older graduate school and medical school students/residents who just need a cheap place to sleep and aren't looking for friends and a social life.

Your friends can sign the lease and find a fifth person over the next 10 months. Not great for them ... apologize profusely. ""Adulting"" can be stressful.",0,0,,,,

I remember going through this with my friends when I was in college. It's one thing to be looking for a place to live but when you get into the specifics such as rent, utilities, and reading the paperwork, it's okay to change your mind. Around this time, college kids are looking to renew leases, or sign new leases. Yes time is running out but you've come to the realization before, but there's still time to consider other options, plus it sounds like no one has signed a lease yet so you and your friends can find somewhere else to live if you're still considering living with them.",-4,0,,,NTA,

Post,1gkhfq7,AITA for refusing to let my wife spend my money on her best friend? ,Unknown,2024-11-05 21:10:27,"My wife has known her best friend since middle school. Her friend is a lawyer and her family is quite well off. She makes a lot and is pretty generous with it. My wife has had a few things paid for by her. Specifically she covered my wife’s portion of her bachelorette trip. The other friends didn’t make much and so she covered it. She also paid for a portion of my wife’s rent twice and she normally pays the bills if she and my wife go out for food. 

This friend is now marrying a doctor and I don’t think they have any trouble with paying for anything they want. My wife is a SAHM and I’m a mechanic. I bought home a bonus of $3k and when I told my wife she immediately started talking about getting her friend a really expensive necklace from this brand she knows her friend really wants. She showed me and the cheapest necklace is $2k on the website. She insisted I should spend the bonus on a wedding gift for her friend. I shut her down and told her it’s my bonus and she really cannot expect me to buy her friend something this expensive. I don’t think wedding gifts even exceed $100. She began fighting with me saying I buy lunch out of the house and I have stupid hobbies that cost a lot of money so why can’t she spend some money like buying her friend a necklace?

I do spend a bit on my hobbies and I have 2 cars but I also work my ass off and her friend can definitely pay for it herself. She is marrying a doctor and they already have a house whereas we are still renting! I told her she is being insane and she insists we sit down and tally up everything I spent on myself in the last year and if it’s higher than 2k I should pay for the necklace. I think it’s ridiculous to compare the 2 and I’m refusing to let her buy her friend a ridiculously expensive gift. She insists her friend has spent a lot on her and I also saved money because her friend pays for meals and activities whenever they hang out so she doesn’t have to spend our money. I get that the lope sided relationship isn’t the best but then she should refuse to do anything that costs too much and let her friend decide if she wants to just hang out without doing anything that costs money. She refuses to talk to me now and I’m wondering if I’m the asshole here?

Potentially the asshole for what sounds like an uneven distribution of money and/or input on how it’s spent. When the spouse is a stay at home, the breadwinner can’t lay total claim to income. “My money” vs “our money”.

Supporting your stay at home spouse requires more than just ensuring their bare necessities are covered while you spend unilaterally on expensive hobbies and multiple vehicles, then complain about renting instead of owning your home. Your wife has a valid reason to question your cumulative ‘fun money’ expenses. 

If you’re legitimately concerned about whether you’re the AH, you should oblige her and tally up everything you’ve spent this year on yourself. You may find that she’s right, you spend big on you and she gets scraps. Some would consider that financial abuse when factoring in the power dynamic play.

As said in other comments, you don't give your wife any money of her own to spend on herself or whatever, she has to discuss non essential purchases with you, she has no money so her well-off friend pays, and yet you impulse purchased a car without discussing with her.

If you had been giving her $100 a week to spend on whatever she liked, maybe she would have saved $2000 to spend on her friend... but she can't because you keep her a beggar.

When someone is a stay at home parent and home maker, while the other partner works outside of the house... that is not individual money. That is shared money! She is working at home, so you can work out of it, and that wage is hers too. Sure, your bonus can be your own... but maybe this time, your wife gets the bonus to make up for the fact that you haven't been treating her fairly financially for as long as she has been home.",1991,0,,,YTA,
Comment,1gkhfq7,AITA for refusing to let my wife spend my money on her best friend? ,StartTalkingSense,2024-11-05 21:33:54,"OP, my husband has been a stay at home dad when our boys were young because I generated a far bigger income from my growing business and we agreed that if the kids were with at least one of us, it didn’t matter who. They went to daycare for 1 day each , after we had the twins because he literally had his hands full.

Right from the first week we agreed on an amount each for “hobby money/fun money “. It was **exactly the same amount** for both of us despite our large income disparity.

We can spend this money how we wish, it’s where birthdays gifts to each other comes from. ALL other money are joint funds for bills, savings , pension etc.

My question to you is; Why do you think *you* deserve hobby money “because you work hard” and think you deserve it, but your wife doesn’t?

Believe me, I worked 16 hour days in the beginning, getting things off the ground, and even with just the one child at the time, I realized that I had the easier deal!  My husband couldn’t take a break unless the baby was sleeping, he was exhausted from constantly being on the lookout for safety issues, choking hazards, making baby food and feeding, playing with our son, reading him stories, walking the floor with him when he was teething, or had cramps. We both did night duty, so we were both tired, but he had no let up. He LOVED being a stay at home papa, but once our younger two started school he was also rather relieved.

He said; “I wouldn’t have missed those years for the world, but I never ever want to do them again”.

Parenting alone with small kids **IS A JOB, and a stressful one at that, why does your job “deserve” a hobby fund but hers not?**

**Your wife deserves money she can save up and blow on a gift for her friend, money she doesn’t have to run the purchase by you first, and get your permission to spend - just as you don’t get her permission to spend your hobby money.**

**If you don’t see that, and clearly you don’t, then it means you don’t see her work, the effort put into the “job” of raising your children of any value. You are effectively saying you don’t even see it as work! If I were your wife would be not just pi@@ed off, I’d feel SO demeaned, so shame on you!**

I also do want to add that this is likely not about her friend needing the money, but more about expressing appreciation for a friend who seems to spare no expense for her most of the time. In all likelihood your wife either feels a little bad that her friend spends so much money on her, or just saw an opportunity to reciprocate and show her friend how much she means to your wife/ how much her help over the years has meant. 2k out of a 3k bonus is probably too much, but I think you should consider that your wife is doing this as a token of love and appreciation for a friend and as a thank you for past support, rather than viewing it purely through a financial support lens. 

Given the resource distribution, I think you should give your wife 1.5k of the bonus and just say she can spend it however she wants.",12,0,,,,

YTA she either needs to get a job and you now have to evenly distribute chores and both contribute to the cost of child care or she gets her own money from you as she's doing a service you don't want to have to step up and do for yourself.

Post,1gkbmkz,AITA for Not Ordering My BF Food of His Choice?,Healthy-Tackle-8752,2024-11-05 17:07:06,"I (F21) have been going out with my BF (M21) for 2 months now. He’s in engineering and i’m in business. he had a paid internship this summer that paid him thousands of dollars each month. meanwhile my internship was free. I’ve come to notice that after he pays for one dinner or a meal, he conveniently “leaves his wallet” and has “0 battery” when we have to eat out/order restaurant food the next time and i have to pay for it.

I have 0 problem paying for food after he has paid for the previous meal but he doesn’t even let me offer and imposes a sort of avoidable situation at me as to why he can’t pay for the particular meal and i have to pay for it. 

i thought i was overthinking but yesterday, on our 2 month mark, he was liek i wanna have a gourmet burger, not wendy’s, i thought he was going to pay for the food delivery, but then this voice inside me said “worst case scenario, i have to pay for our 2 month dinner”, which was fine with me because i was going to offer anyways but i just thought that yk usually it’s the guy who pays for big meals. anyways, he conveniently told me “im at 1% battery rn”, 3 hours before we ordered food online. when he told me that, i could see whatever he told me 3 hours later coming from a mile away. i told him to charge his phone asap because he was at home and his charger was right next to us. i offered to even give him his charger, he said no. instead, he proceeded to play a game on his phone, causing it to die. 

then after 3 hours, he said “babe you’ll have to order food today, i’m out of energy”, i expected that from a mile away. and he was fully expecting me to pay for his $30 each burger when he came up with that lame excuse. to test that theory out, i said “im tired too, not in the mood to eat”. lie. right after i said that, he was literally not the same person anymore. he was full of energy and even told me to stay awake, “the night has just started”.  I was right, it was just an excuse to not spend any money. the worst part is that i was going to offer ordering it anyways but i just wanted to test my theory, and i was supposedly right. 

I was hungry anyways and i wasn’t gonna rely on him to get me anything. i ended up ordering a plain cheese pizza cuz i ain’t buying that man a gourmet burger liek i originally planned to if need be because he has done this so many times before. like he knew we were going to eat and he has conveniently forgotten his wallet and phone so many times. AITA not ordering my bf the food of his choice?  

EDIT: HE IS REALLY REALLY SWEET BUT THIS IS THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE. HE IS VERY NICE OTHERWISE. AND HE DOES PAY FOR MEALS, IT’S FOR SUBSEQUENT MEALS WHEN HE ACTS LIKE THIS.

EDIT + mini update: hey guys, i do agree that im being sort of immature as well, i did send him a text upon one of y’all’s suggestions: “hey babe, don’t get mad but i’ve been observing something, you know I don’t mind paying for our meals, or taking turns paying, right? I’ve been feeling like you’ve been trying to create a reason you can’t pay, maybe so as not to hurt my feelings? If so, I’d really just prefer it if you could just ask me to cover this one like beginning of us hanging out on that specific day, or wait for me to offer. like i have no problem.

I (F21) have been going out with my BF (M21) for 2 months now. He’s in engineering and i’m in business. he had a paid internship this summer that paid him thousands of dollars each month. meanwhile my internship was free. I’ve come to notice that when he pays for a dinner or a meal, he conveniently “leaves his wallet” and has “0 battery” when we have to eat out/order restaurant food the next time and i have to pay for it.

I have 0 problem paying for food after he has paid for the previous meal but he doesn’t even let me offer and imposes a sort of avoidable situation at me as to why he can’t pay for the particular meal and i have to pay for it. 

i thought i was overthinking but yesterday, on our 2 month mark, he was liek i wanna have a gourmet burger, not wendy’s, i thought he was going to pay for the food delivery, but then this voice inside me said “worst case scenario, i have to pay for our 2 month dinner”, which was fine with me because i was going to offer anyways but i just thought that yk usually it’s the guy who pays for big meals. anyways, he conveniently told me “im at 1% battery rn”, 3 hours before we ordered food online. when he told me that, i could see whatever he told me 3 hours later coming from a mile away. i told him to charge his phone asap because he was at home and his charger was right next to us. i offered to even give him his charger, he said no. instead, he proceeded to play a game on his phone, causing it to die. 

then after 3 hours, he said “babe you’ll have to order food today, i’m out of energy”, i expected that from a mile away. and he was fully expecting me to pay for his $30 each burger when he came up with that lame excuse. to test that theory out, i said “im tired too, not in the mood to eat”. lie. right after i said that, he was literally not the same person anymore. he was full of energy and even told me to stay awake, “the night has just started”.  I was right, it was just an excuse to not spend any money. the worst part is that i was going to offer ordering it anyways but i just wanted to test my theory, and i was supposedly right. 

I was hungry anyways and i wasn’t gonna rely on him to get me anything. i ended up ordering a plain cheese pizza cuz i ain’t buying that man a gourmet burger liek i originally planned to if need be because he has done this so many times before. like he knew we were going to eat and he has conveniently forgotten his wallet and phone so many times. AITA not ordering my bf the food of his choice?

Whoever is paying should be the one deciding where to eat. Otherwise I get the feeling he'd want a $30 burger when it's your turn to pay and McDonald's when it's his turn to pay.

At least, based on my (admittedly possibly overreaching) inferences from one paragraph, of the available options, this best describes you.

So, your husband, who is ""amazing"" at science, ""helped"" your son, but your son, rather than turn in the presumably correct assignment that your husband ""helped"" him on, did a new version by himself and turned that in. Did it occur to you at all to wonder why that is? Why did he ignore a perfectly good project and make an inferior version from scratch? Sounds to me that your son would rather get a poor grade on work that he did himself than get a good grade on something your husband did. That shows maturity on his part, and is a red flag to me as far as you and your husband. 

If your husband's ""help"" results only on your son having a finished output that is good, but doesn't result in your son being able to create a good finished output on his own, then how exactly is your husband helping him? The purpose of homework isn't the output, it's the learning. You've been in education for 20 years and you don't understand that?

What exactly do you think redoing it will involve? Do you think he deliberately did a poor job, and he will somehow magically do a better job the next time if you just ask him to do it again? Do you think telling him that what he did wasn't right will somehow make him know what \*is\* right? My guess is he's just going to feel pressured to copy the version that his dad ""helped"" him on so you can pretend that he's actually learning.

You really need to take a good hard look at how you and your husband are approaching your son's education. Your son is not learning the subject matter, and rather than addressing that, you are addressing the symptoms. Your post doesn't have any discussion of what you're doing to try to figure out why your son isn't learning, or trying to figure out how to address the fact that he isn't learning. All you care about is him creating good projects, i.e. the \*appearance\* of learning.",-6,0,,,YTA,
Comment,1gk6tzm,AITA for making our son redo an assignment?,VV_kay,2024-11-05 14:42:39,"It seems like you're a bit of AH here but there's also valuable context missing.

Why I think you're the AH? If your kid's teacher thought he should redo the assignment they would have said so. You're paying them to do a job, let them do their job. If you really want to help the kid learn from his mistakes, you need to find out why those mistakes were made and target the root source next time he gets an assignment.

Like, did he not understand the science while it was taught to him? Find out why and make up for it. Maybe he needs to hear something twice or with more elaborate examples to get it, next time he has a science class, give him a 10' revision of what he learnt today in a way you know he understands. Or maybe did he not understand the assignment? Next time make sure you help him have a clear picture of what the assignment asks of him? Was it another factor completely? Could he not concentrate? Was he anxious, distracted, stressed and could not do his best? Target that.

As for the missing context, I'm wondering why the son redid the assignment in the first place? Why didn't he turn in the one he did with his dad's help?",-3,0,,,,

Post,1gjy9l8,AITA for opening my husband’s package? ,pplplsrrrr,2024-11-05 04:10:10,"I (28) and my husband (30) just married earlier this year. Since we took our relationship to the next level, we decided to not renew our lease with our roommate and get our own spot. During the past 6 months of living together, just us two and my cat, I mostly get a ton of packages sent to our door. 

Whenever I place orders, especially through Amazon, I always give my husband a heads up. Not for any other reason. Yesterday, I gave him a heads up that I was ordering 3 things for my sibling. I was the first to get home today and noticed 3 packages. I ordered my sibling semi big things, and immediately opened up the boxes to wash before I head their way tonight. Shortly after opening the first box, I noticed a bright color that couldn’t have been what I ordered. I quickly checked the address, it was addressed to my husband, and I set it aside and continued to open the other 2 boxes. Somehow Amazon figured out a way to condense my order only into 2 packages. I thought nothing of it. 
My husband and I then had our daily ‘after-work’ phone call, where we discuss what happened throughout our days and he quickly threw out that he should have a package waiting for him. I then told him I accidentally opened it, but set it aside for him to completely open when he got home. 

The conversation then took a turn when he began to scold me about opening his packages. I reminded him of my order and explained to him that it wasn’t intentional. That I was just expecting my orders for my sibling and wanted to prepare their stuff before I gave it to them later. This explanation wasn’t good enough. 

My husband made it seem that I was being negligent, and that “common sense is to look at the address before opening any package or mail”. Although I agree with this, I don’t feel like it’s necessary when the packages are delivered to OUR door. I was expecting the package and opened it because I thought it was mine. I also feel since we are married, it shouldn’t matter that I opened the package on accident. It’s not like I took everything out. I simply took my key swiped it across the tape and noticed it wasn’t mine, and set it aside. 

After arguing in circles, his solution was for me to check every label before opening anything and my solution is a heads up after placing an order. I told him I’ll work on looking at the label, but he thinks it’s unnecessary to tell me when he’s expecting a package. We left the conversation annoyed at each other. I know this issue is so minute, but he really thinks that I’m lacking common sense. So like, AITA?!

I see all your comments. I understand that opening his package was wrong. I forgot to mention as part of the conversation, first thing I did was apologize. 
“I’m sorry, I opened your package on accident.” And continued to apologize throughout our argument. 

It was an argument because we both had different perspectives on packages being sent to our place. If he opened one of my packages I would not have cared. Just set it aside for me, and he likes to open his own packages, which I totally get. I can’t stress enough that it was just a simple mistake. I didn’t read the label because I really thought it was mine. 

I do not open his packages on purpose or regularly. I don’t go through his phone. I don’t go into the bathroom when he’s shitting. Whatever else, I respect him and his privacy. 

A lot of you think I intentionally opened his package without remorse and just said fuck it. I can do what I want. We’re married. 
—————————

I would not care if he opened any of my packages. In fact, he probably doesn’t because I tell him what it is before hand. Like I said, I do most of the ordering. He’ll ask me to place orders for him on my own Amazon account. Even though we have separate accounts. This has never been an issue for me or us, really. I do not open his packages. It was a mistake on my part. I never denied this. I’ll be the AH, but I do think better communication would help our situation.

OP for not respecting her husband's opinion when he expressed what he wanted to happen. And as far as Amazon condensing the packages,  they tell tou they will do that when you check out. It says something like ""ship together to reduce trips to your house "".
Also, if OP haD looked at the name on the address prior to just opening the boxes she wouldve seen it was to him. If she wanted to know what he ordered she could've just set the package aside and asked him later what it was. 
My husband and I had seperate amazon accounts. We would tell each other when we expected a package. But we knew not to ask what it was unless it was already something we prior discussed before purchasing. i knew my husband ordered gifts for me from amazon. So I wouldnt open his packsges. Its a respect thing. 

And Husband for making a bigger deal out of it than necessary and scolding OP. All he had to do was say ""please just make sure you are opening the right package"" but I'm wondering if he actually scolded OP because of how OP treated it like it wasn't a big deal and seems to be offended that he was even upset. As women, we always want our spouses to respect our emotions. How about we respect our husband's emotions as well? All OP had to do was apologize for opening the package. Then both needed to discuss a plan for when more packages arrive instead of getting upset. 

OP says ""My husband made it seem that I was being negligent, and that “common sense is to look at the address before opening any package or mail”. Although I agree with this, I don’t feel like it’s necessary when the packages are delivered to OUR door.""

It IS common sense to look at the address before opening packages. What if the package was wrongly delivered? Like a neighbors package? GPS gets my address and my neighbors address wrong all the time. And a lot of times Amazon delivers her packages to my door. Even if she leaves instructions. Lol. 

 And OP agreeing with her statement to check the address, but then commenting like its not a big deal to check them is dismissing how her husband feels. 

""I also feel since we are married, it shouldn’t matter that I opened the package on accident.""

Again OP not respecting her husbands feelings on the matter. If it is a big deal to him then it needs to be a big deal to her and not just be dismissed. Accidents happen but it could've been avoided if she used common sense and had respect for her husband. 

""his solution was for me to check every label before opening anything and my solution is a heads up after placing an order. I told him I’ll work on looking at the label, but he thinks it’s unnecessary to tell me when he’s expecting a package.""

Why should he give a heads up about getting a package when all OP had to do was read the label and set the package aside. While I do think a heads up would be nice, it isn't something he should HAVE to do. He is an adult and can order stuff when he wants to.",9,0,,,,

You  should have checked the label... But you are the A-H for not taking responsibility, and trying to shift the blame onto him. You don't need to check without a 'heads-up' when he orders something.  The fact that you 'don’t feel like it’s necessary when the packages are delivered to OUR door' is immaterial, because your husband disagrees, and it was HIS parcel. You can 'feel' however you want about your OWN parcels. Nowhere does it say you admitted to him that you were wrong or apologized. You just make excuses for why you were not wrong.

I (28) and my husband (30) just married earlier this year. Since we took our relationship to the next level, we decided to not renew our lease with our roommate and get our own spot. During the past 6 months of living together, just us two and my cat, I mostly get a ton of packages sent to our door. 

Whenever I place orders, especially through Amazon, I always give my husband a heads up. Not for any other reason. Yesterday, I gave him a heads up that I was ordering 3 things for my sibling. I was the first to get home today and noticed 3 packages. I ordered my sibling semi big things, and immediately opened up the boxes to wash before I head their way tonight. Shortly after opening the first box, I noticed a bright color that couldn’t have been what I ordered. I quickly checked the address, it was addressed to my husband, and I set it aside and continued to open the other 2 boxes. Somehow Amazon figured out a way to condense my order only into 2 packages. I thought nothing of it. 
My husband and I then had our daily ‘after-work’ phone call, where we discuss what happened throughout our days and he quickly threw out that he should have a package waiting for him. I then told him I accidentally opened it, but set it aside for him to completely open when he got home. 

The conversation then took a turn when he began to scold me about opening his packages. I reminded him of my order and explained to him that it wasn’t intentional. That I was just expecting my orders for my sibling and wanted to prepare their stuff before I gave it to them later. This explanation wasn’t good enough. 

My husband made it seem that I was being negligent, and that “common sense is to look at the address before opening any package or mail”. Although I agree with this, I don’t feel like it’s necessary when the packages are delivered to OUR door. I was expecting the package and opened it because I thought it was mine. I also feel since we are married, it shouldn’t matter that I opened the package on accident. It’s not like I took everything out. I simply took my key swiped it across the tape and noticed it wasn’t mine, and set it aside. 

After arguing in circles, his solution was for me to check every label before opening anything and my solution is a heads up after placing an order. I told him I’ll work on looking at the label, but he thinks it’s unnecessary to tell me when he’s expecting a package. We left the conversation annoyed at each other. I know this issue is so minute, but he really thinks that I’m lacking common sense. So like, AITA?!

Post,1gjyyhu,AITA for Not Sharing My Family’s Pasta Sauce Recipe with My Friend?,AreaNo6163,2024-11-05 04:50:05,"

I (28F) have this old family recipe for pasta sauce that’s been passed down for generations. My mom taught me when I was a kid, and over time, it’s become “my thing.” I make it for all sorts of occasions—birthdays, family gatherings, and even just nights in with friends. Everyone raves about it, and I take a lot of pride in keeping it close to the original.

One of my closest friends, Emily, recently asked me for the recipe. She’s been experimenting in the kitchen lately and thought it would be fun to try making it herself. At first, I kind of laughed it off, saying something like, “Oh, maybe I’ll teach you someday,” but she kept pressing. Emily isn’t Italian and doesn’t have a lot of experience cooking from scratch, so I was a little hesitant. It felt weird giving away something that feels so tied to my family, especially since my mom always treated it as a bit of a “family-only” thing.

I tried explaining that it was a family recipe, and I didn’t feel comfortable giving it out. She got pretty annoyed, saying it was just sauce and not some “huge family heirloom.” She pointed out that I’d shared recipes with her before (which is true, but those were random ones I found online, not family recipes).

Now things are awkward between us. She’s been short with me ever since and even made a snarky comment at a dinner party about how I “gatekeep sauce.” A few mutual friends think I should’ve just given it to her to avoid drama, but others understand why I wanted to keep it private.

So… AITA?",201,342,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gjyyhu/aita_for_not_sharing_my_familys_pasta_sauce/,"The final verdict is: **Not the A-hole**

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 > I told her I wasn't ready to share the recipe, she got upset and accused me of being selfish. She said it was just a sauce and that I was being ridiculous for not wanting to share something that could bring us closer as friends. I felt bad when she called me selfish because I value our friendship, and I started to wonder if I was overreacting.

I have to say, though, that if you give someone a recipe—99 percent of the time, it will taste different when they make it anyway. They may use different brands, may have a different mixing style… heck, even a different stove/oven makes a difference in how something cooks. A friend makes “my” blondie recipe to the tee, and it tastes different. So if you DID give it to her, and she DID say “I use Soandso’s family recipe,” I think most people would understand that the way YOU make it and how SHE makes it would come out different.

It’s a family recipe, and it’s a sacred thing especially for Italians. Don’t share it. If she’s petty enough to lose a friendship over it, that’s on her. 

My great grandmother, started a little thing to keep the recipe secret without offending her friends that ask for the recipe. She adds in an ingredient or two, that don’t ruin the recipe, but the results are not as good as when she makes it. All the family recipes have superfluous ingredients listed and only family members know which ones they are. We just have to remember which ones, because they aren’t written down anywhere, still a closely held secret. Sometimes she would withhold which ingredients were extra, if she didn’t like the new person that married into the family. She was a spitfire.",2,0,,,NTA,

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 > I might be the asshole because my best friend told me to keep this December and January free for her potential wedding date. At sounded like it was going to be New Years, but no date had been finalized. The possibility of the wedding being anytime in January slipped my mind, and I ended up booking a 3 week non-refundable vacation over MLK weekend for my husband’s birthday. Now her wedding sounds like it’s going to be on MLK weekend, and she’s upset I won’t cancel my trip to be there. I feel bad, but canceling would cost me a lot and her date has not been finalized yet. AITA for not cancelling?

I'm going to echo the sentiment that people need to get over the idea that their wedding is the only thing that matters and everyone needs to drop everything to accommodate them. Everyone should just elope and have a party later. The ceremony isn't even that interesting.

My best friend (26F) and I (25F) have been close since childhood. She’s been with her fiancé for about three years, and because of cultural reasons, it was a pretty big fight for them to get family approval for marriage. They finally got engaged around six months ago, and I was thrilled when she asked me to be her maid of honor. 

The thing is, she never set an official wedding date. Both of their families have conflicting schedules and limited availability but told me she was thinking sometime in December or January and to keep my availability open. It sounded like she was leaning towards New Year’s Eve, as that was the date she would reference when talking about the wedding. I mentally filed that away as “the date,” but still nothing was set yet. She had also mentioned it could be as late as April, but since nothing was confirmed, I kind of focused on the idea of New Year’s.

In the meantime, I booked a trip for January over MLK weekend for my husband’s birthday. I spent a lot on this vacation (about $5,000), and the flights are non-refundable, with a cancellation fee. Since the vacation includes an international flight and multiple domestic flights (all non-refundable with cancellation fees), i would lose over $7,000 cancelling this trip. I’ll admit, it completely slipped my mind that her wedding could fall within these January dates when I was making these plans and I should have run my vacation through her. 

Recently, her fiancé’s grandmother got sick, and they had to shuffle their plans. Now, the date that seems to work best for everyone is, of course, MLK weekend. She told me she thought she kept me informed enough that I should have avoided booking anything in January.

She’s upset with me and thinks I should cancel my trip, saying that I’m prioritizing my vacation over her wedding. It’s a very small and intimate wedding, with only immediate family and three main friends she would want to be there (one of which being me). And I get it – I feel terrible. I know it’s her wedding, and I want to be there for her. She did so much for my wedding. But on the other hand, it’s not a small financial hit, and the wedding date is still technically not confirmed. 

So, AITA for not cancelling this trip?

It's wholly unreasonable to not secure a date and to expect people to effectively block out 5 months in anticipation of them getting their shit together. Dates for weddings need to be secured pretty early on, not just to ensure that wanted guests can come, but also to ensure vendors' availability. You cannot put your life on hold, your life which consists of more people than just your friend, because she keeps flipflopping with dates. It's now November, so they have very little notice as it is for their guests.

Stick to your vacation because it isn't fair on your husband to pull out of your prior commitment, which includes his birthday, for your friend who perceives her last minute wedding to be a better invitation.",-2,0,,,NTA,

Last friday my Wife and I took our 2 kids under 3 to the playground in our neighborhood park.  This was a rare Friday where there were no commitments as we usually take them first thing in the morning.    

As we approached we noticed there were probably a dozen kids there and 2 large labs running in the grassy area unleashed.  My wife and I are like the dogs shouldn't be there unleashed but our little guy was excited to be at the playground.  So we continued.  We let our boy run around and the younger one we put in the swing.  Some parents that were there started talking to us.  They are essentially one big neighborhood parent group and meet up weekly.  I didn't know anyone in this group.  

My son climbed a structure and went down a slide.  Once he was off the slide there were no kids on that structure.  A lady that had the 2 dogs there (I still don't know if she was a parent), let the dogs onto the playground structure and let them go down the slide. 

I spoke up to this lady and told her to keep her dogs off the equipment.  She told me they were her service dogs.  I said, i don't think service dogs play on playground equipment.  She snaps back to me service dogs are allowed to take breaks. She continues saying that we are here every week and no one has ever complained.  I say that not everyone is comfortable around dogs and tell her I think its selfish to let your dogs on the equipment especially when children are around.   

Some parents support her and said as much to my wife and I.    She told me that I should make sure my kids are comfortable around dogs before bringing them around dogs.   I told this lady that she was insane and completely missed my point.  My wife and I left after this.  We noticed a facebook post about us (that we have not engaged) and it seems its 50/50 on if we are the assholes.  ",3109,1254,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gjquni/aita_for_telling_a_wheelchair_bound_lady_her/,"The final verdict is: **Not the A-hole**

As a parent with young children under three, I would have seen the dogs and went to a different park. I love dogs (most of the time). But I always err on the side of caution when it comes to dogs I don’t know. I am also disabled and have spent a lot of time with service dogs. Most, if not ALL, service dog handlers take their dogs to dog parks to help them get out energy and play. Not parks where children play.

It just seems like such a dumb risk. What if a child was allergic to dogs? What if a child decided to “play” with the dogs and the dogs got hurt? What if the dogs knocked a child off the play equipment? There’s just so many unknowns when it comes to strange dogs and strange children.

The ADA clearly states that service animals must be “harnessed, leashed, or tethered” unless it would somehow prevent them from fulfilling their service.

But if the dogs were, per their owner, “off duty”, then *there’s no possible service a leash could prevent them from performing.*

She got caught in a lie and didn’t like it, but what she’s doing is a safety hazard to all the children at the playground as well as the dogs themselves.

As a service dog handler, that lady is in the wrong. Sure, our dogs aren’t robots and they need time to unwind and just be a dog. There’s plenty of appropriate dog places to let them be dogs, or if you just *really* want to let them on the playground, go when there’s no children. 

There is always a risk when taking a service dog to a dog park, so I can possibly understand if that was part of the reasoning. BUT! Children take priority on a playground. You don’t get to just bully your way in because service dog. 

Also, just to address it, it is possible to have 2 service dogs. It’s usually only seen when 1 dog is getting close to retirement, but it can also happen if the dogs serve different purposes.",20,0,,,NTA,

This has nothing to do with whether they were service dogs, b/c they weren't service dogs ""working"". They were service dogs ""on a break"" (or they weren't service dogs, whatever).  Whatever they were doing, these are strange dogs in an area designed for young children.

Go to a dog park.  I even understand running in a field, if otherwise empty.  But they shouldn't be on a busy playground.  Service dogs shouldn't even be accessible to others, especially children who have no self-control.

I also think people have audacity telling others what they should and should not be afraid of.  You don't know those dogs. You have a small child.  You are right to have a concern over your child's safety, and that trumps a dog's right to have fun (especially in a place for children!!!

NTA.

I bring my dog to the park when I go with my kid, and  only ever allow him to have free time there if it's just us. If anyone else shows up, he's called to heel and put back on task. It isn't safe to let large dogs play amongst other people's children no matter how well trained they are. If your medical needs require leashless voice/whistle/hand signal control, it's your responsibility as their handler to keep them close and under firm control just the same as if they had a leash on when in public. If they lack perfect recall, they shouldn't be off leash.

Service animals are legally considered medical equipment, not pets, so they can go wherever their owners go, but only if the owner has *and exercises* complete control over the animal. They are NOT allowed to run amok in places dogs are not normally allowed, on leash or off. So if there are no dogs allowed signs at the park, she was in the wrong.",3,0,,,NTA,

Throwaway, People are making me feel like i'm nuts here, and I can't believe this is real.  

Last friday my Wife and I took our 2 kids under 3 to the playground in our neighborhood park.  This was a rare Friday where there were no commitments as we usually take them first thing in the morning.    

As we approached we noticed there were probably a dozen kids there and 2 large labs running in the grassy area unleashed.  My wife and I are like the dogs shouldn't be there unleashed but our little guy was excited to be at the playground.  So we continued.  We let our boy run around and the younger one we put in the swing.  Some parents that were there started talking to us.  They are essentially one big neighborhood parent group and meet up weekly.  I didn't know anyone in this group.  

My son climbed a structure and went down a slide.  Once he was off the slide there were no kids on that structure.  A lady that had the 2 dogs there (I still don't know if she was a parent), let the dogs onto the playground structure and let them go down the slide. 

I spoke up to this lady and told her to keep her dogs off the equipment.  She told me they were her service dogs.  I said, i don't think service dogs play on playground equipment.  She snaps back to me service dogs are allowed to take breaks. She continues saying that we are here every week and no one has ever complained.  I say that not everyone is comfortable around dogs and tell her I think its selfish to let your dogs on the equipment especially when children are around.   

Some parents support her and said as much to my wife and I.    She told me that I should make sure my kids are comfortable around dogs before bringing them around dogs.   I told this lady that she was insane and completely missed my point.  My wife and I left after this.  We noticed a facebook post about us (that we have not engaged) and it seems its 50/50 on if we are the assholes.

Post,1gjc9pm,AITA for making a woman lose a costume contest?,MarionberryApart1482,2024-11-04 11:44:17,"So I am the events chair of my fraternity for the semester and I planned out a Halloween party that happened yesterday.

At the party we typically have a huge costume contest. You pay 5 dollars to enter and if you win, you win the pot. We usually pull about 30 to 50 entries. So the prize is pretty nice. This year we had 40 people enter and about 160 people attending. 

In years past, the winner has been this one specific chick That my brothers wanna fuck. Her costume is usually the typical sorority girl costume (an animal of some kind, boots, fishnet leggings, a short skirt, basically a bra or corset, and then animal ears and light face paint). 

Now I’m not a Halloween nazi. This year my costume was literally just a angel wings, and white shorts, and a halo. I know fully that I’m dressing up so hot guys that think I’m hot will take notice and that it’s not a “good costume”. Her costume isn’t good. Sure, she looks good in it. But the point of the party is who has the best breasts

So we have the contest, and she’s wearing her MO. She was a bee, but her ass was hanging out and her boobs were about to fall out of her shirt. So we held the contest, people voted anonymously, and guess what. She won. But by one vote. I hadn’t voted yet, so I simply casted my vote then my vice chairman, who agreed with me casted his vote. That just happened to be enough to put her at second place. 

When I told my by brothers they bitched and moaned about it, but I told them she simply didn’t win and she should do better next year. They eventually talked me into creating a runner up prize of 50 dollars to the girl.

When we announced the winner, she was visibly upset. This was the first time she hasn’t won in the last 4 years. Now apparently, last night one of my brothers was simping hard and told her that I intentionally voted against her because I didn’t like her (not true, I’m genuinely apathetic about her).

She found me later that night and cursed me out and said I had a problem with her. I told her simply that we weren’t having a sluttiest costume contest, but a best costume contest and that she’s lucky we bent the rules to give her 50 bucks. We argued and ended up getting separated.

Now a lot of my brothers are pissed at me for pissing her off.

That just happened to be enough to put her at second place. 

When I told my by brothers they bitched and moaned about it, but I told them she simply didn’t win and she should do better next year. They eventually talked me into creating a runner up prize of 50 dollars to the girl.

When we announced the winner, she was visibly upset. This was the first time she hasn’t won in the last 4 years. Now apparently, last night one of my brothers was simping hard and told her that I intentionally voted against her because I didn’t like her (not true, I’m genuinely apathetic about her).

She found me later that night and cursed me out and said I had a problem with her. I told her simply that we weren’t having a sluttiest costume contest, but a best costume contest and that she’s lucky we bent the rules to give her 50 bucks. We argued and ended up getting separated.

Now a lot of my brothers are pissed at me for pissing her off.

You're all taking a competition far too seriously.

If ""sexy"" is a way to win then that is the nature of the contest. These are frat guys. Of course they're going to vote for whoever's hottest.

You shouldn't have got to vote after votes were counted. The vice chair really shouldn't have voted I don't see why there couldn't have been a tie with the prize money split.

Since there wasn't a rule about joint first place, then there's no reason to split the money.

A few months ago, my grandmother informed us that she would be moving to another state and inquired whether we had a place to live. She provided very little notice, with a deadline of March, which has made it challenging to find suitable housing in the current market for two young adults. After a few days of house hunting, she suggested that we rent her house at the price of the mortgage, and we agreed to this arrangement, even discussing the possibility of my friend becoming a roommate.

However, we overlooked my grandmother’s history of controlling behavior, which soon became evident. She imposed restrictions on decorating the house and established various rules that had not been discussed previously. Given that we had lived with her for seven years, we should have anticipated this behavior. Her reactions have been exacerbated by the recent loss of my grandfather last November, which has been difficult for all of us.

After a recent argument and her increasingly controlling attitude, we resumed our house hunt and ultimately found our dream home, with a closing date set for December 4th. We have decided not to inform my grandmother until we are ready to move, as she tends to interfere in others' affairs and can be quite negative. We are thrilled about purchasing our first home and wish to protect this joyful moment from any potential negativity.

Now, I find myself questioning whether it is wrong to keep this news from her. I haven’t spoken to her in a week and am beginning to doubt our decision to withhold information, as we want to navigate this significant transition without added stress. But am I the asshole in this situation

The reality is that she might be counting on you leasing the property to manage her finances. While that's not your problem, the decent thing to do would be to give her as much notice as possible so that she can make other plans.

She can't interfere with your purchase of your home, she has no buy-in so the only thing she can achieve is negativity. If that's the case, well not to be too blunt but that's a her problem.

Not letting her know means that she's expecting a regular tenant that she doesn't have to go through the fuss of using a real estate agent etc. for. Or selling it, if she can't afford to keep both mortgages.

Essentially the nuke will go off at some stage. Leaving it to the last minute will just ensure that the order of magnitude is off the scale. You're not going to avoid the negativity, you're just kicking it down the road and potentially leaving her in a sticky situation to boot. She might be negative and controlling, but she's counting on your word. Stay good to your word, and let her know asap of changes.

Post,1giwkq5,AITAH My girlfriend took my car without permission ,jesseny23,2024-11-03 20:36:16,"A year ago, my girlfriend and I met at work, but we've only been dating for 3 months. We became close after she experienced a traumatic event and I wanted to support her due to my own experience with abuse. We fell in love quickly despite our pasts. Although we both have trust issues, we're learning to communicate and work through our disagreements. However, she often threatens to end the relationship when she gets upset, causing stress for me.

Halloween night, we were having fun at my house.  I was trying to clean up before bed, but I was in a lot of pain due to a back injury. I commented ""I feel like a maid."" She instantly got upset. I calmed her down and apologized, telling her I'm  in pain so everything feels harder than normal.

She asked for a ride to get clothes for work the next day, but I'd been drinking and didn't feel safe driving. She said she felt fine, asking to drive my car instead. I agreed, telling her to text me when she was on her way back. She took all her things with her, which seemed odd since she coming back.

After falling asleep briefly, I woke up to find her gone and a text saying she wouldn't be returning my car, but would pick me up for work in the morning. I tried calling her but it went straight to voicemail and she wasn't answering my texts. With a spare car and house key, I decided to take an Uber to her apartment so we could talk. I quickly learned she suspended my access code to get into the apartment complex. I was locked out and unable to contact her. Feeling furious, I ended up driving my car back home, unable to resolve the situation.

She called me in the morning, upset because I was mad at her for taking my car. I explained she can't keep it without permission. I said ""you knew you weren't coming back when you took all her things last night."" Her response was ""so!"" I stated she should've taken an Uber instead. She angrily agreed to return my car and hung up on me. I decided to let her panic by not revealing that I already had the car.  

She called 38 times and texted repeatedly, asking if I had the car, but I ignored her. After 45 min, I called her revealing I had taken it last night to teach her a lesson. She was furious! Saying ""never contact me again, please get help!""

At this point she still had my car keys with my house/mail/parents' keys attached to them. Asking her to bring them back, she ignored me by putting her phone on do not disturb. I warned her I'd call the police if she didn't return them. After waiting and getting no response, I called the police to help. They couldn't come for hours due to being busy. Worried that she may have thrown my keys away, I changed the lock on my front door. Later that day, she returned my keys, including the spare key I gave her, leaving them on my doorstep. I only saw her back as she was leaving, but she seemed sad.

Am I the ass hole for trying to teach her a lesson? Would you have been upset if you were me? Should I reach out to her or let her come to me?",234,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1giwkq5/aitah_my_girlfriend_took_my_car_without_permission/,"The final verdict is: **Not the A-hole**

My spouse has mentioned a few times that he finds eggshells in them. I grew up with my Mom cracking a soft boiled egg with one hard smack in the middle of the eggs. If I had some shell in it I would spit it out or eat it. My spouse asked me to make him some this morning. I made him the eggs in an egg cooker. Toasted him his toast and said it was ready. I left him in charge of his egg cracking, so I wouldn't have to hear about the shells. Now we are in a fight and he says he will not cook for me anymore because I didn't provide him with a complete breakfast. I actually cracked one egg and asked him to do his other one. Instead of doing that he only ate the egg I put on his toast and the other toast on top. Never cracked his own egg.

So your mom thought it was ok to serve eggs with the shell but it's not unreasonable to expect that the person making eggs makes an effort fo remove the shell which clearly your mom didn't do and you don't care to either.

Instead of doing what is reasonable, your approach is do it yourself.  I find that logic to be total crap.  You wouldn't like your hsuband to do something for you in a shoddy manner because that's how his Dad did it right?

As a couple you do things for each other - it you're maoing breakfast how hard is it to properly peel the shell?  

Saying we do the thjngs we do because our parent did it like that - you're a grown woman you can do better.  

I would actually also be pretty pissed with you.  When I do thinks for my spouse I do it well and I want the same energy when he does things for me.

This year, we finally saved enough to plan an amazing trip to my home country, where she could meet my family and see where I grew up. We spent six months planning it and were excited.

The trip was a tour of several cities, visiting family and exploring. Things went well until the last city, where I planned to meet my dad (who raised me after my parents divorced) and some aunts. My wife mentioned she had a friend in town she might see, and I was fine with that. But when we arrived, she got sick and felt terrible, so she wanted to stay in bed and insisted I go see my family without her. I stayed with her for a bit, got her food, and told her to reach out if she needed anything. I visited some friends and later returned to the Airbnb that night.

The next day, she was still unwell, and again urged me to go meet family. I had lunch with my aunt, who was asking me about my wife and even suggested medicine for her when I told her she was sick. After lunch I told my aunt I was going back to the Airbnb to check on my wife, and on my way there I texted her asking how she was feeling to which she replied she was still very sick and with a massive headache. She told me to stay out, to go and enjoy my time in the city, so I decided to walk around my old neighborhood and eventually met up with my dad at a mall. That’s when my wife texted, saying that her friend had texted her saying he wanted to meet up with her and go grab a coffee, and she pretty much said that since her friend lives in Florida and now they happened to be in the same city she did not want to lose on the opportunity, this happened around 5 p.m. I was surprised but told her okay. I was with my dad until 11 p.m. and then I went back to the Airbnb. She was not there yet when I arrived and ended up coming back at around 1 a.m.

On our last day, my family invited us to breakfast. I got ready early, and my wife suddenly felt better and wanted to join. I told her it felt too late—she had chosen not to meet them before, so I went alone. Throughout the day, she blew up my phone, accusing me of cheating, and claiming that my behavior meant I must’ve reconnected with an ex or met someone. She didn’t seem to consider that while she was too sick to meet my family, she was fine meeting her friend.

Yes, her staying out until 1 AM after feeling sick all week was kind of rude. But it also sounds like U2 just don’t communicate well. What was the point of you not allowing her to see your family the next day? If you were upset with her about staying out until 1 AM, maybe you could’ve communicated that with her. Also, couldn’t you have communicated with her while she was out and said hey if you’re out with your friend, how about come meet me and my dad and join us for a little bit as well. Since you were out late with your dad as well.

You could have communicated in the moment that you were disappointed she chose to see her friend rather than rest for your final day so she could meet your family. 

It was petty of you to have spent 4 years planning a trip for her to meet your parents to deny her that chance. 

I also don't understand how you managed to spend the whole day apart from her and only question if you were wrong when she made accusations. Surely you knew it wasn't okay to exclude her like that. 

Her behaviour wasn't considerate of you or your family and it seems strange she was well enough to be out until early in the morning after having been ill. 

She should have returned early to prioritise meeting your family on your last day.

My wife (F33) and I (M30) have been married for four years, and during that time, we haven’t had a chance to visit my family abroad, partly due to COVID-19. This year, we finally saved enough to plan an amazing trip to my home country, where she could meet my family and see where I grew up. We spent six months planning it and were excited.

The trip was a tour of several cities, visiting family and exploring. Things went well until the last city, where I planned to meet my dad (who raised me after my parents divorced) and some aunts. My wife mentioned she had a friend in town she might see, and I was fine with that. But when we arrived, she got sick and felt terrible, so she wanted to stay in bed and insisted I go see my family without her. I stayed with her for a bit, got her food, and told her to reach out if she needed anything. I visited some friends and later returned to the Airbnb that night.

The next day, she was still unwell, and again urged me to go meet family. I had lunch with my aunt, who was asking me about my wife and even suggested medicine for her when I told her she was sick. After lunch I told my aunt I was going back to the Airbnb to check on my wife, and on my way there I texted her asking how she was feeling to which she replied she was still very sick and with a massive headache. She told me to stay out, to go and enjoy my time in the city, so I decided to walk around my old neighborhood and eventually met up with my dad at a mall. That’s when my wife texted, saying that her friend had texted her saying he wanted to meet up with her and go grab a coffee, and she pretty much said that since her friend lives in Florida and now they happened to be in the same city she did not want to lose on the opportunity, this happened around 5 p.m. I was surprised but told her okay. I was with my dad until 11 p.m. and then I went back to the Airbnb. She was not there yet when I arrived and ended up coming back at around 1 a.m.

On our last day, my family invited us to breakfast. I got ready early, and my wife suddenly felt better and wanted to join. I told her it felt too late—she had chosen not to meet them before, so I went alone. Throughout the day, she blew up my phone, accusing me of cheating, and claiming that my behavior meant I must’ve reconnected with an ex or met someone. She didn’t seem to consider that while she was too sick to meet my family, she was fine meeting her friend. I have a lot of emotions, but for now: AITA?

I (F) was playing games with my boyfriend, and his friends. We played a game where the goal is to make a controversial prompt that the players of the game will be split on. The more split it is, the more points. 

Some more background about me, this is important. I was adopted by other relatives and have lived with them since I was 1. My bio mother is dead and has been for my entire life. I don't remember anything about her. 


I dont fully remember what the prompt was, it was something about either getting money or having to delete the only picture of something you have off your phone. My boyfriend filled in the blank and wrote that the only picture you'd have to delete would be of your birth mom. 
I immediately said I felt targeted, and he told me I was. I was not happy and I asked him why he did that in our DMs. He told me he did it because he wanted to win and wanted the split. He said sorry, but, he was insistent that he thought it wouldn't be a big deal and i wouldn't be so hurt. He told me he felt awful afterwards and like I had gotten way too upset. AITA?

Your boyfriend will sell you out for personal gain; he will hurt you for personal gain. He's willing to that for just a game, so what would he do if the stakes were higher and more serious?

An ""apology"" that is accompanied by first implying and then later outright stating that you're making a big deal and getting too upset about nothing is not an apology. It's a backhanded way of telling you to stop making a fuss and he is openly dismissing and invalidating your feelings.

What he's really saying is that he didn't believe you'd stand up for yourself and call out his behaviour, and that he's upset you're holding him to account.

I know this game and play it a lot with my friends. The goal really is to come up with a controversial prompt, and it's actually really common (when we play at least) to do this by ""targeting"" a person (or 2-3 when playing in a larger group) with something personal. We switch up who we ""target"" and tend to go for the people we're closest to first/more, so that it doesn't become bullying.

Telling me that I'd ""targeted you"" wouldn't necessarily register as you being upset with me, because that's the language we use (that or ""attacked"") along with jokes about going home, not playing anymore, a partner sleeping on the sofa etc.

However, that doesn't mean that you can't have boundaries. It's absolutely valid to have things that are too personal to be joked about, and once you've communicated that it shouldn't be used in future. The person should also apologise. It sounds like this happened here, so NAH.",1,0,,,NAH,

I would never play a game like this with you ever again after this. I’m not saying what he did was right but I am saying that you should stick to games that won’t trigger you because you seem to be a bit soft and this is a touchy subject.

Post,1gi5k6b,AITA for refusing to eat the food my FIL made and lying about why?,Unknown,2024-11-02 20:25:45,"So I (26F) have been married to my husband Nikolas (29M) for over a year. He was raised in the UK, his father his Greek and his mother is English. When his parents got divorced, his father moved back to Greece, and because Niko has always had a strained relationship with his father, they don't talk or see each other very much - but they tend to get together to have dinner whenever he's back in the UK. 

This time he was back for a month and he rented out an apartment and so he invited around the both of us around - he didn't specify that we were going to eat anything, just said we could have a few drinks and chat. I've only met him once or twice before now, and I didn't see any reason not to do so and figured that it would be some good backup for Niko if he wanted to leave early or anything. So we went around yesterday at around 9pm. 

When we got there, FIL had made a traditional Greek dish called spanakopita (sort of like a pie but it's made with filo pastry, it has spinach and feta). For context, I have a history of anorexia, and eating in front of people that I don't really know is still an issue for me, and anything with pastry is something that I tend to avoid even now. He was pleasant enough, welcomed us all in and offered us the food, and I said no thank you because I was anxious with the situation. 

Niko caught on that I was uncomfortable and so told his dad that we'd already eaten, but his dad kept insisting that we should try it. At us saying no again, he got very up in arms about how he'd gone to the effort of making the food, and that it shouldn't be such an issue for us to just have some of it, and that he felt as though we were disrespecting him by refusing to eat the food. 

So husband and I apologised, offered to stay for drinks, but ultimately left as he remained angry about the situation. I know I could have explained why I didn't want to eat it, but I felt uncomfortable trauma dumping on him about the real reason why, or I could have tried a little bit and then just left it and he probably would have been fine.

I have a condition where unless I know exactly what is in food (and how it was prepared) I run the risk of reacting poorly to it. Innocuous things like ""too much of any form of fat - vegetable oils, nut oils, fatty meats"" will cause me to react to it.

A cornerstone of hospitality in many places across the world is food. Food is used as a point of connection - and it is really difficult for those of us who, for whatever the reason, trying to feed us is basically an act of aggression 😂

It can be uncomfortable to disclose, but if you give people (lost words, editing in) *a chance* to be understanding - a lot of the times, they *want* to understand. I don't want to talk about my medical situation. But when I offer a little insight, people are typically very warm and accepting.

You're NTA for not eating, but it might be fair to consider a somewhat sanitized explanation you can offer (both Niko's father, and to others in the future) that give people a general idea of your reasoning, which means you can avoid someone identifying you as rude or unwelcoming (which again - isn't fair, for those of us with difficult relationships with food, it's really difficult because meals are such a foundation for bonding, social outings, hospitality, etc - being thought of as rude for not partaking in a meal stinks for us, but that's the environment we're operating in so we should understand the common assumptions we're going to have to contend with)",5940,0,,,NTA,

All things that are good and fine. But I do think it could have been handled a lot better. I think the way it was handled definitely could have been interpreted as rude.

Ok so for context I come from a background where food is literally everything. We use it to show love, to make up, to have tough conversations, to gossip, to bond, to exchange our days, our kitchens are literally the heart of the family and the house. There are a lot of foods that make me really unwell (not allergies but I bloat and become really nauseous and uncomfortable) and that’s been really tough for my family. My grandma being the angel that she is, always makes sure there are foods I can eat at her house (even when I’m not over, just in case I do come) for example with every meal she’ll ensure there’s a soup at the very least that I can eat but fill me. This would never have happened and these compromises would never have been made unless we spoke and talked about how I was feeling and how uncomfortable I would become after eating. 

My partner is also on a very strict deficit diet, so he needs to know exactly what he is eating and how it was prepared (thankfully when offered traditional foods I can quietly explain to him what’s in it and how it would have been made).

As I said I come from a similar culture where food is an expression of emotion and connection and hospitality. So when we walk into anyone from my cultures house it’s always “eat” or “I made some X please try some.” And honestly it would be rude to totally deny them. Our go to is usually “thank you so much (add respectful title for whoever we’re addressing) unfortunately we won’t be able to eat too much but we would love to try some because it looks and smells amazing!” You eat a tiny bit then gush about how amazing it is and how you’re really sad you can’t eat more. They’ll usually give you an overflowing plate to take home, which you can eat at your leisure.

So I (26F) have been married to my husband Nikolas (29M) for over a year. He was raised in the UK, his father his Greek and his mother is English. When his parents got divorced, his father moved back to Greece, and because Niko has always had a strained relationship with his father, they don't talk or see each other very much - but they tend to get together to have dinner whenever he's back in the UK. 

This time he was back for a month and he rented out an apartment and so he invited around the both of us around - he didn't specify that we were going to eat anything, just said we could have a few drinks and chat. I've only met him once or twice before now, and I didn't see any reason not to do so and figured that it would be some good backup for Niko if he wanted to leave early or anything. So we went around yesterday at around 9pm. 

When we got there, FIL had made a traditional Greek dish called spanakopita (sort of like a pie but it's made with filo pastry, it has spinach and feta). For context, I have a history of anorexia, and eating in front of people that I don't really know is still an issue for me, and anything with pastry is something that I tend to avoid even now. He was pleasant enough, welcomed us all in and offered us the food, and I said no thank you because I was anxious with the situation. 

Niko caught on that I was uncomfortable and so told his dad that we'd already eaten, but his dad kept insisting that we should try it. At us saying no again, he got very up in arms about how he'd gone to the effort of making the food, and that it shouldn't be such an issue for us to just have some of it, and that he felt as though we were disrespecting him by refusing to eat the food. 

So husband and I apologised, offered to stay for drinks, but ultimately left as he remained angry about the situation. I know I could have explained why I didn't want to eat it, but I felt uncomfortable trauma dumping on him about the real reason why, or I could have tried a little bit and then just left it and he probably would have been fine. AITA?

To me, it should be common sense that a big ass truck is loud. Heck, that's probably one of the reasons they bought it. While you could've handled it better, that type of stuff builds up. You probably had neighbors in their beds applauding you. BUT.... I might suggest going over there later and saying, ""sorry about what I said when I was exhausted...."" and maybe explain how he's waking everyone up and wasting gas, or whatever. Good luck and I hope everyone gets some sleep soon.

Dive deeper into your state and local laws and ordinances on noise levels, emissions, and unattended idling cars. Our town has an ordinance that a gasoline fueled commercial vehicle can’t idle more than 5 minutes during a 60 minute period and personal vehicles 15 minutes. My neighbor’s daughter used to get home from work late at night and she would sit in her car and let it idle while she listened to tunes and smoked pot. It was so annoying.

If that leads nowhere, call the non-emergency police number and ask them to do a welfare check on a vehicle that been idling for a more than 15-20 minutes. Act like you’re concerned that something happened to the neighbor.",4,0,,,,

My roommate caught me looking for something to smash his windshield in with one morning. I barely remember this - but I had apparently very noisily gotten a pipe for a hammock stand out of the closet and she came out of her room to me trying to figure out how to get ouside to put it through his windshield. She got me to go back to bed. 

He was military and she had friends on the same base and got him reported. I don't know the precise results but he stopped parking near the building and eventually undid the illegal muffler job.

My neighbour keeps idling his big, noisy truck at 4-5am outside my house, waking me and others up regularly. Most of the time he isn’t even in the vehicle. Until now I have said nothing, because my spouse didn’t want to rock the boat. 

This morning we both went outside and once my partner saw who it was immediately went back in. I couldn’t contain myself and began yelling at him from outside my house — I angrily said “stop doing this!” possibly including a few expletives. 

My partner got angry at me for doing this. AITA? 

I’m so tired — and it’s so unnecessary on the neighbour’s part — the truck is new and it’s a balmy 80 degrees so he doesn’t need to warm the engine…

Next time at work I heard he called the cops and was chewed out when they found it at the frat house with his keys in the ignition. He never left it running again.
Just take his truck to the nearest police station and Uber home.  That should take care of it.

Record the engine noise and replay it at odd times, when he is home (attach a cheap bluetooth speaker).  He will think his truck is being stolen.  A running truck surely has the keys in it?  

Or when he turns it on, at 5am, have the bluetooth speak play loud and expensive sounding, metal crunching and grinding noises.  I have never owned a blue tooth speaker, not sure if you can get enough volume/decibels, to be convincing.

Reminds me of the car TV advert, where the car had an odd squeaking noise, that confused the driver.  Mechanic added a drop of oil, to the sleeping girlfriends big, dangling earings, problem solve.  I think they were bragging about how quiet the engine was, or something.",2,0,,,,

Go get a conduction speaker, which is wireless, that will turn any flat surface into a speaker. Then at a properly stealthy moment place in on a strategically optimal window.(somewhere hard to see on the glass would be best like up high)

Record the god damn truck and play it back at optimal time periods for only about 10 to 15 seconds at full tilt boogie. Then radio silence until
