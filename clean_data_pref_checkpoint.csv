REASONING: Based on my comment, I agree that going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay (2). I also think that forcing someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries (3). Sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation (4), and not respecting someone's wishes can make them feel uncomfortable or even stressed (9). I agree that a simple 'thank you' or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation (10). I agree that everyone involved is trying to do the right thing, but some methods are better than others (6), and it's better to be transparent and direct when showing appreciation, rather than sneaky or manipulative (7). Instead of paying for services, consider doing something nice for the person, like taking them out for a meal (5) and making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment (8). I think respecting people's wishes and boundaries, even if it's a kind gesture (1) is less important than the other statements because it's important to consider the other person's feelings and boundaries."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the most liked statement is ""Going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay."" (statement 2) because it directly addresses the issue of secretly paying someone. I also agree with ""Sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation."" (statement 4) and ""Forcing someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries."" (statement 3) because they are related to the action taken by the poster.

I can see why ""Respect people's wishes and boundaries, even if it's a kind gesture."" (statement 1) and ""Not respecting someone's wishes can make them feel uncomfortable or even stressed."" (statement 9) are important, but they are less specific to the situation. Similarly, ""A simple 'thank you' or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation."" (statement 10) and ""It's better to be transparent and direct when showing appreciation, rather than sneaky or manipulative."" (statement 7) are good principles, but they don't stand out as much as the other statements.

I agree with ""Consider making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment."" (statement 8) and ""Instead of paying for services, consider doing something nice for the person, like taking them out for a meal."" (statement 5) because they offer alternative ways to show appreciation. However, they are less directly related to the issue at hand.

Finally, I agree with ""Everyone involved is trying to do the right thing, but some methods are better than others."" (statement 6) because it acknowledges that people are generally well-intentioned, but it doesn't stand out as much as the other statements."

Statement 4, sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation, is a method that I disagree with. Statement 3, forcing someone to accept something they don't want, is also a violation of their boundaries.

I understand you and your dad's thought process, but asking you to slip money into his wallet was not the way to do it. It's overstepping and disrespectful.

First off, you shouldn't be involved AT ALL.  Your dad wants to compensate your boyfriend for tutoring, and your boyfriend feels like he's repaying a debt to your dad for saving his dad's life (or at least giving him health back).  You are not respecting that, and over involving yourself.  Also, don't go through his wallet.

Your dad can thank him and pay him, certainly. Normally, a good way to do this is to give him a card with a gift card in it. (Not sure where you are, or if that's possible).",29,0,,,YTA,,"YTA I understand you and your dad's thought process, but asking you to slip money into his wallet was not the way to do it.

REASONING = Based on my comment, I strongly disagree with the actions of the poster, hence statement 2 (going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay) is the most liked statement. Statement 4 (sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation) is similar to my comment and also strongly agreed upon. Statement 3 (forcing someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries) is also closely related to my comment and is placed third. Statement 1 (respect people's wishes and boundaries, even if it's a kind gesture) and statement 9 (not respecting someone's wishes can make them feel uncomfortable or even stressed) are agreed upon, but less strongly than the previous statements. Statement 6 (everyone involved is trying to do the right thing, but some methods are better than others) and statement 7 (it's better to be transparent and direct when showing appreciation, rather than sneaky or manipulative) are neutral, but still agreed upon. Statement 10 (a simple 'thank you' or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation) is agreed upon, but less strongly than statement 6 and 7. Statement 5 (instead of paying for services, consider doing something nice for the person, like taking them out for a meal) and statement 8 (consider making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment) are least agreed upon, as they do not address the issue of disrespecting boundaries and overstepping."

However, I understand that respecting people's wishes and boundaries is important (1, 2, 3, 9). I also agree that sneaking money into someone's wallet is not the best way to show appreciation (4), and a simple ""thank you"" can be enough (10). I also prefer transparent and direct methods of showing appreciation (7), and I think charitable donations can be a good alternative (8). I understand that everyone is trying to do the right thing (6), but I would still rank the statements that emphasize respecting boundaries higher. I also agree that instead of forcing payment, doing something nice for the person can be a better option (5)."

I agree with statement 10, a simple thank you can be enough. I also agree with statement 7, being transparent and direct is better than sneaky or manipulative. Statement 6 is also reasonable, everyone is trying to do the right thing but some methods are better than others. Statement 1, respecting people's wishes, and statement 9, not respecting someone's wishes can make them uncomfortable, align with my perspective. I disagree with statements 2, 3, and 4, which focus on the negative aspects of the action. Statement 5, making a charitable donation, is a good idea but not directly related to the situation. Statement 8, I would consider this as a better alternative than forcing payment, but it's not the main issue here."

Touching someone else's wallet is not on. It's disrespectful and an invasion of personal space. A nice touch would be a thank you card with a 'loaded gift card' (for a place he'd use/visit) and your brother hands the envelope as a thank you, at an appropriate time interval or to celebrate a certain achievement level.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly disagree with the action of slipping money into someone's wallet (statement 4) and forcing someone to accept something they don't want (statement 3). I agree with respecting people's wishes and boundaries (statement 1), and not going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to (statement 2). 

Furthermore, I believe that being transparent and direct is better than sneaky or manipulative (statement 7), and not respecting someone's wishes can make them feel uncomfortable or even stressed (statement 9). 

I also think that a simple thank you or acknowledgement can be enough (statement 10), and consider making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment (statement 8). 

The other statements (6, 5) are less relevant to my stance, but I still agree with them in the context of this situation."

REASONING = Based on my comment ""Definitely nah"", I believe that slipping money into someone's wallet without their knowledge or consent is not an acceptable way to show appreciation. Therefore, I agree with statements 2, 3, 1, 9, 4, and 10 which express the importance of respecting people's wishes and boundaries, and the negative consequences of violating them. I also agree with statements 7, 6, and 8 which suggest more appropriate and respectful ways to show appreciation. Statement 5, while well-intentioned, seems to miss the point of the situation and is therefore ranked last."

However, I also think that respecting people's wishes and boundaries is important, so I agree with statements 1, 6, 9, and 10. Statement 2 is in disagreement with my comment, so it goes towards the end of the order. Statements 5 and 8, while not directly related to my comment, suggest alternative ways of showing appreciation that are more direct and respectful, so they are placed towards the end of the order."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the boyfriend should not keep the money and should donate it instead. This aligns with statement 2, which states that going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay. Statement 3, which mentions forcing someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries, also supports my stance. Statement 9, which states that not respecting someone's wishes can make them feel uncomfortable or even stressed, further solidifies my position. Statement 1, which mentions respecting people's wishes and boundaries, even if it's a kind gesture, is in line with my reasoning. Statement 4, which states that sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation, is also relevant. Statement 10, which states that a simple 'thank you' or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation, is in line with my comment. Statement 5, which suggests doing something nice for the person, like taking them out for a meal, is not directly related to my comment but still supports the overall theme of showing appreciation without forcing payment. Statement 7, which states that it's better to be transparent and direct when showing appreciation, rather than sneaky or manipulative, aligns with my reasoning. Statement 6, which states that everyone involved is trying to do the right thing, but some methods are better than others, is a neutral statement that doesn't directly relate to my comment.

REASONING: Based on my comment being ""NAH"", I don't think anyone is an asshole in this situation. However, I agree with statements 2 and 3 the most because going behind someone's back and forcing someone to accept something they don't want are clear violations of their boundaries. Statement 1 is similar but less strongly worded, so it comes next. Statement 9 is also related to boundaries and comes after 1. Statements 4 and 10 are about the method of showing appreciation, and I agree more with 4 because sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation. Statement 7 is similar but more general, so it comes after 4. Statement 6 is a more neutral statement that acknowledges everyone is trying to do the right thing, so it comes next. Statement 8 is about making a charitable donation instead of forcing payment, which I agree with but not as much as the previous statements, so it comes after 6. Statement 5 is the least liked statement because it suggests paying for services instead of finding a nicer way to show appreciation, which contradicts my ""NAH"" comment."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the poster is an asshole for slipping money into their boyfriend's wallet without his consent. I agree with statement 2, which says going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay. Statement 3, which says forcing someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries, also aligns with my view.

Statement 4, which says sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation, and statement 10, which says a simple 'thank you' or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation, are both relevant and I agree with them.

REASONING: Based on my comment being ""NAH"", I believe that no one is truly an asshole in this situation. However, there are still some actions that are less preferred than others. I agree with statements 2 and 4 the most, as they directly address the issue of going behind someone's back and sneaking money into their wallet. These actions violate the person's boundaries and wishes, which I ranked as the least liked.

Moving on to statement 3, I agree that forcing someone to accept something they don't want is also a violation of their boundaries. However, I ranked it lower than statements 2 and 4 because the boyfriend did not explicitly say no to receiving the money.

Statement 9 is about making someone feel uncomfortable or stressed by not respecting their wishes. I agree with this statement, but I ranked it lower because the boyfriend did not seem to be overly uncomfortable or stressed in the description.

Statement 1 is about respecting people's wishes and boundaries, which I agree with. However, I ranked it lower because it does not directly address the issue of sneaking money into someone's wallet.

Statement 10 suggests that a simple 'thank you' or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation. I agree with this statement, but I ranked it lower because it does not directly address the issue at hand.

Statement 6 is about everyone involved trying to do the right thing, but some methods are better than others. I agree with this statement, but I ranked it lower because it does not directly address the issue of sneaking money into someone's wallet.

Statement 5 suggests doing something nice for the person instead of forcing payment or compensation. I agree with this statement, but I ranked it lower because it does not directly address the issue of sneaking money into someone's wallet.

Statement 8 suggests making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment. I agree with this statement, but I ranked it lower because it does not directly address the issue of sneaking money into someone's wallet.

Finally, statement 7 suggests being transparent and direct when showing appreciation, rather than sneaky or manipulative. I agree with this statement, but I ranked it the lowest because it does not directly address the issue of sneaking money into someone's wallet."

Sometimes, accepting a small gift of gratitude from someone you were kind to is another act of kindness. If they feel indebted, it can weigh on them, and they may hesitate to ask for help again.

Perhaps if you explain this is how your dad seems to feel, he might be willing to find a happy medium. Lots of people would feel terribly uncomfortable about receiving money as a gift of thanks. But something like your dad taking your boyfriend out for lunch once in awhile, or helping him out with an errand, would be a good way for your dad to feel the slate is clean, your boyfriend's to feel that this is less transactional.

""That my boyfriend shouldn’t feel indebted about it since my dad was more than happy and is still happy about the decision.""

Unfortunately, no matter how much GOOD one can do, there will be those who do good and cannot do good for profit. it violates the moral code and ethic of being good or doing the right thing for the sake of doing the right thing.

I can relate to your BF, as it is MENTALLY PAINFUL to accept money for doing something I DO NOT WANT TO BE PAID FOR. its really as simple as that. I would much, much rather someone say hey dude, thanks for helping. let me buy you lunch. (which is the proposed solution. a  good one i agree with!)

  
You did nothing wrong, i just hope you can understand that FORCING someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries. Even if its silly, and you know he could use the money(not sure if this is the case, more of an example), forcing someone to do something is disrespectful to their ideals. Again, i don't feel you did this with intent, i think you where just trying to do the right thing. 

Also, if your dads saved his dads life, he might be doing this not out of obligation or duty to repay a familial debt, but because he feels its the least he can to do show his gratitude.

For example, if his sole purpose of teaching your brother is some kind of deep seated duty to repay your family for the act of kindness your family blessed his with, you forcing him to accept money he doesn't want is equivalent of him teaching your brother to repay a debt.

In this case, there is no debt(at least from the vibes i get coming from the dads)

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly agree that going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay (statement 2). I also agree with the idea that forcing someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries (statement 3). Sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation (statement 4), and not respecting someone's wishes can make them feel uncomfortable or even stressed (statement 9).

I agree with the statement that a simple ""thank you"" or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation (statement 10), and that it's better to be transparent and direct when showing appreciation (statement 7). I also agree that everyone involved is trying to do the right thing, but some methods are better than others (statement 6).

I slightly agree with the statements that consider making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment (statement 8) and instead of paying for services, consider doing something nice for the person, like taking them out for a meal (statement 5). These statements are less relevant to the situation described in the post, but they still promote positive and respectful behavior.

I disagree with the statement that respecting people's wishes and boundaries, even if it's a kind gesture, is not enough (statement 1). In this situation, respecting the boyfriend's wishes not to accept the money would have been the right thing to do."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the poster is ""marriage material,"" implying that they have good intentions and are thoughtful. However, the act of slipping money into someone's wallet without their knowledge or consent is not an appropriate way to show appreciation. Therefore, I agree with statements 2 and 3, which emphasize respecting people's wishes and boundaries. Statement 1 is also in line with my perspective, as it acknowledges the importance of respecting boundaries, even if the intention is to do something kind.

Statement 9 highlights the potential discomfort or stress that can be caused by not respecting someone's wishes, which aligns with my reasoning. Statement 4 reinforces the idea that sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation, and statement 10 suggests that a simple ""thank you"" can be enough, which I agree with.

Statement 5 suggests an alternative way to show appreciation, which is not directly relevant to the situation but is a valid point. Statement 8 proposes making a charitable donation in someone's honor, which is a good idea but not applicable to the situation. Statement 7 emphasizes the importance of being transparent and direct, which I agree with.

Finally, statement 6 suggests that everyone involved is trying to do the right thing, which is a positive perspective, but I prioritize the importance of respecting boundaries and being transparent and direct."

REASONING = In the comment, I expressed that sometimes ""No"" is a complete sentence and the original poster (OP) is the asshole (YTA) for not respecting their boyfriend's wishes. I agree with statement 2 the most, as it directly addresses going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to. Statement 3 also aligns with my view, as forcing someone to accept something they don't want is a violation of their boundaries. Statement 1 is in line with my opinion, but I rank it lower because it doesn't specifically mention respecting someone's explicit ""No"". Statement 4 is a less appropriate way to show appreciation, but I rank it lower because it doesn't directly address the violation of boundaries. Statement 9 emphasizes the importance of respecting wishes, which I agree with, but I rank it lower because it doesn't specifically mention the violation of boundaries. Statement 10 suggests a simple ""thank you"" as an alternative, which I agree with, but I rank it lower because it doesn't directly address the violation of boundaries. Statement 6 acknowledges that everyone is trying to do the right thing, but I rank it lower because it doesn't specifically mention the violation of boundaries. Statement 7 promotes transparency and directness, which I agree with, but I rank it lower because it doesn't specifically mention the violation of boundaries. Statement 8 suggests a charitable donation, which I agree is a better alternative, but I rank it lower because it doesn't directly address the violation of boundaries. Statement 5, while a nice gesture, is not relevant to the violation of boundaries and I rank it the lowest."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I see all the people involved in this situation as good people, so I agree with statement 6 the most, as it acknowledges that everyone is trying to do the right thing. I also agree with statements 7 and 1, as they emphasize the importance of being transparent and respecting people's wishes. Statement 9 highlights the negative impact of not respecting someone's wishes, which I also agree with. A simple ""thank you"" or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation, which is why I agree with statement 10.

I disagree with statement 2, as it implies that going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay. While I understand the sentiment, I believe that the situation in this post is different.

Statements 3 and 4 are similar in that they both criticize the act of sneaking money into someone's wallet. While I agree that it's not an ideal way to show appreciation, I don't think it's as severe as statements 3 and 4 make it out to be.

Statement 5 suggests an alternative way to show appreciation, but I don't think it's necessary in this situation.

Statement 8 suggests making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment. While I agree that this can be a good alternative, I don't think it's relevant to the situation in this post."

REASONING: Based on the comment, the original poster (OP) is TA (the asshole) for not respecting their boyfriend's wishes and boundaries by sneaking money into his wallet. The most disliked statement is 2, which implies that going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay. This directly contradicts the OP's actions.

Statement 3 is similar to 2, but it focuses on forcing someone to accept something they don't want, which is also what the OP did. Statement 1 is about respecting people's wishes and boundaries, which the OP failed to do.

Statement 4 emphasizes that sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation, which is exactly what the OP did. Statement 9 highlights that not respecting someone's wishes can make them feel uncomfortable or even stressed, which is what the OP's actions led to.

Statement 10 suggests that a simple 'thank you' or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation, which is the opposite of what the OP did. Statement 7 stresses the importance of being transparent and direct when showing appreciation, rather than sneaky or manipulative, which the OP failed to do.

Statement 6 acknowledges that everyone involved is trying to do the right thing, but some methods are better than others, which implies that the OP's method was not the best. Statement 8 suggests making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment, which is a better alternative to what the OP did.

Finally, statement 5 suggests doing something nice for the person, like taking them out for a meal, which is a more thoughtful and considerate way of showing appreciation than what the OP did."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly disagree with the action of slipping money into someone's wallet without their knowledge or consent. This is why statement 3, ""Forcing someone to accept something they don't want is violating their boundaries,"" is ranked first. Statement 2, ""Going behind someone's back to do something they explicitly said no to is not okay,"" is ranked second because it also highlights the violation of the person's wishes. Statement 4, ""Sneaking money into someone's wallet is not a good way to show appreciation,"" is ranked third, as it directly relates to the action in question.

Statement 9, ""Not respecting someone's wishes can make them feel uncomfortable or even stressed,"" is ranked fourth because it emphasizes the importance of respecting boundaries. Statement 1, ""Respect people's wishes and boundaries, even if it's a kind gesture,"" is ranked fifth, as it aligns with my belief that enforced gratitude isn't nice. Statement 10, ""A simple 'thank you' or acknowledgement can be enough, without needing to force payment or compensation,"" is ranked sixth, as it suggests a more appropriate way to show appreciation.

Statement 6, ""Everyone involved is trying to do the right thing, but some methods are better than others,"" is ranked seventh because it acknowledges the intention behind the action but criticizes the method. Statement 7, ""It's better to be transparent and direct when showing appreciation, rather than sneaky or manipulative,"" is ranked eighth, as it highlights the importance of transparency. Statement 5, 'Instead of paying for services, consider doing something nice for the person, like taking them out for a meal,' is ranked ninth because it offers a more respectful alternative.

Finally, statement 8, ""Consider making a charitable donation in someone's honor instead of forcing them to accept payment,"" is ranked tenth because, while it is a respectful alternative, it is not directly related to the situation at hand."

I am a 19 year old first-year college student, who about a week ago, agreed with a group of 5 friends that I'd be interested in living with them next school year. 

Yesterday, we found a place we really liked and talked about how we'd figure out the lease by the end of the week. Today they've decided they want to sign the lease ASAP/by tonight because the landlord explained that the market is competitive and they don't want to lose this nice house... But, reading through the lease has made me realize I don't want to do this financially. 

Even with the 5 of us, this would cost me $750/month or $9k to live there for august 2025-july 2026, not counting utilities... and that is money that could go towards classes (I am paying for school by myself and just came back from a gap year of working. I do not want to take any loans and have a lot of anxieties about going into debt after college because it happened to mom and it still effects her). My family also lives close enough to campus that I can just stay with them without having to pay anything.  

These friends are all from out of town so they need to find a place to stay. I feel like a dick now for saying I don't think I can as soon as they are trying to sign the place, because I definitely could with the money I have saved, but I know I'll regret it in the future. I know I really don't want to, but feel like I have to because they don't have anyone else and they need 5 people.

Right now I am banking on the fact that my parents refuse to co-sign, but I technically wouldn't need them because my credit score is better than the both of them. Do I continue to lie and say that my parents are the reason I can't sign? Most if not all of these places require us to have co-signers because we're so young, but my parents' financial history are so poor they don't think they'd be approved as co-signers

I feel like an asshole because this is causing them a lot of anxiety, but it would be better for my own anxiety in the long run if I stayed at home and saved the money... I don't know how any of them are paying for school, so I feel awkward and kind of like an asshole for suddenly saying I couldn't afford it.

I feel like a dick now for saying I don't think I can as soon as they are trying to sign the place, because I definitely could with the money I have saved, but I know I'll regret it in the future. I know I really don't want to, but feel like I have to because they don't have anyone else and they need 5 people. Right now I am banking on the fact that my parents refuse to co-sign, but I technically wouldn't need them because my credit score is better than the both of them. Do I continue to lie and say that my parents are the reason I can't sign? Most if not all of these places require us to have co-signers because we're so young, but my parents' financial history are so poor they don't think they'd be approved as co-signers I feel like an asshole because this is causing them a lot of anxiety, but it would be better for my own anxiety in the long run if I stayed at home and saved the money... I don't know how any of them are paying for school, so I feel awkward and kind of like an asshole for suddenly saying I couldn't afford it. (How would you/should I go about this without ruining my relationship with these people? I don't want to screw them over but know I will if I pull out, which is what I want to do...)",

Therefore, I put statement 10 (This behavior is a red flag and you should consider ending the relationship.) at the top of the list. Statement 6 (His behavior is not just about money, it's about respect and honesty.) is also highly agreed by me, because it's not only about money, but also about the friend's attitude and values. Statement 9 (You're enabling his behavior by not addressing it directly.) and 8 (He's being cheap and cowardly by not being upfront about his intentions.) are also highly agreed by me, because the OP should not enable the friend's behavior and the friend should be honest and direct. Statement 2 (You should have an open conversation about splitting costs and not play games.) and 5 (You're both adults and should be able to discuss this without playing games.) are agreed by me, because the OP and the friend should have an open conversation about splitting costs. Statement 3 (It's reasonable to split costs 50/50, but his methods are weird.) is agreed by me, because it's reasonable to split costs 50/50. Statement 1 (He's playing games to avoid paying for meals and it's manipulative.) and 7 (You should reevaluate the relationship if he's not willing to have an open conversation.) are a little agreed by me, because the friend is playing games and the OP should reevaluate the relationship. Statement 4 (He's trying to see if you're willing to pay for meals without him asking directly.) is the least agreed by me, because it's not clear if the friend is trying to see if the OP is willing to pay for meals or not."

I agree with statement 1 because the friend is indeed playing games to avoid paying for meals, which is manipulative. Statement 2 aligns with my comment as I suggested having an open conversation about splitting costs. Statement 3 is partially agreeable as splitting costs 50/50 is reasonable, but the friend's methods are weird. I agree with statement 5 that both adults should be able to discuss this without playing games. Statement 9 resonates with me as enabling his behavior by not addressing it directly is not a good approach. Statement 4 is somewhat agreeable, but it seems the friend is not even willing to see if the OP is willing to pay for meals. Statement 8 is partially agreeable as the friend is being cheap, but I believe it's more about respect and honesty. Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, which I find reasonable given the friend's behavior. Lastly, statement 10 is the most extreme and I do not completely agree with it, as it may be too hasty to consider ending the relationship based on this issue alone."

Statement 9, which suggests addressing the issue directly, is also ranked high. Statement 5, which emphasizes open communication, is ranked in the middle. Statements 3 and 2, which suggest splitting costs 50/50 and having an open conversation, are ranked lower because they don't address the underlying disrespect and manipulation. Statement 4, which acknowledges the friend's indirect approach, is ranked lower.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe the friend in question is being irresponsible and manipulative with money. Therefore, statements that highlight his disrespectful behavior and the negative impact on the relationship are ranked higher. Statement 10 is ranked first because it summarizes the overall sentiment of my comment, emphasizing that this behavior is a red flag and the relationship should be reconsidered. Statement 6 follows, as it highlights the respect and honesty aspect of the issue. Statement 9 is ranked third, as it suggests that enabling this behavior by not addressing it directly is also a concern.

Statements 7, 2, and 5 are ranked next, as they emphasize the need for open communication and addressing the issue directly. Statement 1 is ranked last, as it slightly downplays the severity of the situation by attributing it to a game, while I believe the friend's actions are more intentional and disrespectful.

The remaining statements (8 and 4) are ranked lower because they focus on the friend's perceived cheapness, which I believe is a secondary aspect of the issue. Statement 8 is ranked lower than 4 because it uses stronger language, such as ""cowardly,"" which I did not explicitly mention in my comment."

Statement 2 suggests having an open conversation, which I also agree with, so it is fourth. Statement 5 is similar to statement 2, so it is fifth. Statement 3 is reasonable but does not address the friend's manipulative behavior, so it is sixth. Statement 1 is partially correct but does not fully address the friend's behavior, so it is seventh. Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, which I agree with, so it is eighth. Statement 8 calls the friend cheap and cowardly, which I also agree with, but it is last because it does not suggest ending the relationship.

I also agree that both parties should be able to discuss this without playing games (statement 5) and that the friend's methods are weird (statement 3). Statement 1 aligns with my view that the friend is playing games to avoid paying for meals. Statement 2 suggests having an open conversation about splitting costs, which I also agree with, but I put it after statement 1 because the friend's behavior is disrespectful and not just about money. Statement 9 emphasizes the need to address the friend's behavior directly, which I agree with. Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, which I also agree with, but I put it after statement 9 because addressing the behavior directly is a necessary first step. Statement 8 calls the friend cheap and cowardly, which I agree with, but I put it after statement 7 because it's less focused on the solution. Statement 10 is the most extreme statement, suggesting ending the relationship, which I put last because it's a drastic measure that should only be considered after all other options have been exhausted. Statement 4, which suggests that the friend is trying to see if the OP is willing to pay for meals without him asking directly, is the least liked statement because it seems to make excuses for the friend's behavior."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the original poster (OP) is the asshole. The OP has valid concerns about the living arrangement and the landlord's behavior. The slate statements that I agree with the most are those that highlight the importance of respect and honesty in the situation (6, 5, 3). I also agree that playing games is not an effective way to handle the situation (2, 1). However, I strongly disagree with statements that blame the OP for enabling the friend's behavior or that suggest ending the relationship (9, 10). I believe that the friend's behavior is a red flag, but it's not necessarily indicative of a toxic or unfixable relationship (7, 4). Therefore, I have ranked the statements in order of how much I agree with them, starting with the ones I agree with the most and ending with the ones I disagree with the most."

Statement 2, ""You should have an open conversation about splitting costs and not play games,"" and statement 3, ""It's reasonable to split costs 50/50, but his methods are weird,"" both suggest a solution to the problem, but they don't fully capture the disrespectful and dishonest nature of the friend's behavior.

I remember going through this with my friends when I was in college. It's one thing to be looking for a place to live but when you get into the specifics such as rent, utilities, and reading the paperwork, it's okay to change your mind. Around this time, college kids are looking to renew leases, or sign new leases. Yes time is running out but you've come to the realization before, but there's still time to consider other options, plus it sounds like no one has signed a lease yet so you and your friends can find somewhere else to live if you're still considering living with them.",-4,0,,,NTA,,"NTA I remember going through this with my friends when I was in college.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the person is an asshole and both parties should communicate openly. Statement 5 aligns with this the most as it emphasizes the need for open conversation. Statement 2 follows next as it also highlights the importance of communication, but it implies that the OP has been playing games which I don't fully agree with based on the description. Statement 3 is reasonable but his methods are not entirely wrong, so it's lower in the ranking. Statement 9 is about addressing the issue directly, which I agree with, but it's not as important as having an open conversation. Statement 1 is about manipulation, but it's not explicitly stated in the description, so I rank it lower. Statement 6 includes respect and honesty, which I agree with, but it's not the main issue here. Statement 4 implies that the friend is testing the OP, but it's not clear, so I rank it lower. Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, which is a bit extreme based on the description. Statement 8 calls the friend cheap and cowardly, which I don't fully agree with, so it's towards the end of the ranking. Statement 10 is about ending the relationship, which is the most extreme, so it's last in the ranking."

I put statement 5 (You're both adults and should be able to discuss this without playing games.) and 3 (It's reasonable to split costs 50/50, but his methods are weird.) after, as they suggest a more equal distribution of costs.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the husband's behavior is not just about money, but also about respect and honesty (statement 6). I agree with statement 1, which also mentions the husband's manipulative behavior. Statement 5, suggesting that both parties should be able to discuss this without playing games, aligns with my perspective. Statement 3, which mentions the reasonableness of splitting costs 50/50, is something I can agree with, but I find the husband's methods weird. Statement 4, which highlights the husband's intention to test the wife's willingness to pay for meals, is also something I can see happening.

I do not agree with statement 2, which suggests that the wife should have an open conversation about splitting costs, because the husband should be the one to initiate the conversation. Statement 9, which suggests that the wife is enabling the husband's behavior, is not entirely fair, as the husband is the one being manipulative. Statement 8, which calls the husband cheap and cowardly, is a strong statement that I don't fully agree with. Statement 10, which suggests ending the relationship, is an extreme measure that I don't think is warranted based on the information provided."

They went to daycare for 1 day each , after we had the twins because he literally had his hands full.

Right from the first week we agreed on an amount each for “hobby money/fun money “. It was **exactly the same amount** for both of us despite our large income disparity.

We can spend this money how we wish, it’s where birthdays gifts to each other comes from. ALL other money are joint funds for bills, savings , pension etc.

My question to you is; Why do you think *you* deserve hobby money “because you work hard” and think you deserve it, but your wife doesn’t?

Believe me, I worked 16 hour days in the beginning, getting things off the ground, and even with just the one child at the time, I realized that I had the easier deal!  My husband couldn’t take a break unless the baby was sleeping, he was exhausted from constantly being on the lookout for safety issues, choking hazards, making baby food and feeding, playing with our son, reading him stories, walking the floor with him when he was teething, or had cramps. We both did night duty, so we were both tired, but he had no let up. He LOVED being a stay at home papa, but once our younger two started school he was also rather relieved.

He said; “I wouldn’t have missed those years for the world, but I never ever want to do them again”.

Parenting alone with small kids **IS A JOB, and a stressful one at that, why does your job “deserve” a hobby fund but hers not?**

**Your wife deserves money she can save up and blow on a gift for her friend, money she doesn’t have to run the purchase by you first, and get your permission to spend - just as you don’t get her permission to spend your hobby money.**

**If you don’t see that, and clearly you don’t, then it means you don’t see her work, the effort put into the “job” of raising your children of any value. You are effectively saying you don’t even see it as work! If I were your wife would be not just pi@@ed off, I’d feel SO demeaned, so shame on you!**

I also agree with statement 10, suggesting that this behavior is a red flag and might warrant reconsideration of the relationship.

I agree with statement 7, which suggests reevaluating the relationship, but I rank it lower because I believe that addressing the behavior directly should be prioritized before considering ending the relationship.

Therefore, statement 10, which suggests ending the relationship, is the most agreed upon. Statement 6, which highlights the respect and honesty aspect, is also highly agreed upon. Statement 9, which criticizes enabling his behavior, and statement 2, which suggests open communication, are also agreed upon. Statement 5, which emphasizes being adults and discussing things, and statement 3, which agrees with 50/50 cost splitting but dislikes his methods, are somewhat agreed upon. Statement 1, which mentions manipulative games, and statement 8, which calls him cheap and cowardly, are less agreed upon. Statement 4, which speculates his intentions, is the least agreed upon."

Statement 6 is ranked second because the husband's behavior is not just about money, but also about respect and honesty. Statement 7 is ranked third because the relationship should be reevaluated if the husband is not willing to have an open conversation. Statement 9 is ranked fourth because the wife is enabling the husband's behavior by not addressing it directly. Statement 2 is ranked fifth because an open conversation about splitting costs should be had instead of playing games. Statement 3 is ranked sixth because while splitting costs 50/50 is reasonable, the husband's methods are weird. Statement 5 is ranked seventh because both adults should be able to discuss this without playing games. Statement 4 is ranked eighth because the husband is trying to see if the wife is willing to pay for meals without him asking directly. Statement 1 is ranked ninth because the husband is playing games to avoid paying for meals, which is manipulative.

REASONING = Based on my comment, I think the husband is in the wrong and his behavior is a red flag (10). His behavior is not just about money, but also about respect and honesty (6), and this is a major issue that should be addressed in the relationship (7). The wife should not enable this behavior (9), and should consider ending the relationship if the husband is not willing to have an open conversation (10). Both parties should be able to discuss this without playing games (5), and the husband's methods of trying to see if the wife is willing to pay for meals without asking directly are manipulative (1). The husband's behavior is cheap and cowardly (8), and the wife should reevaluate the relationship if he is not willing to have an open conversation (7). I agree that it is reasonable to split costs 50/50 (3), but the husband's methods of trying to do so are not appropriate (1). I also agree that the husband should have an open conversation about splitting costs (2), but this is less of a concern for me than the husband's manipulative and disrespectful behavior (10, 6, 7, 9, 5)."

Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, which is also a serious concern. Statement 9 implies that the wife is enabling the husband's behavior, which I think is a valid point. Statement 2 suggests having an open conversation, which I agree with, but I put it lower because the husband is not being straightforward about his intentions. Statement 5 is similar to statement 2, but it implies that both parties should be able to discuss this, which I think is a valid point. Statement 3 is more neutral, as it acknowledges that splitting costs 50/50 is reasonable, but the husband's methods are weird. Statement 1 implies that the husband is playing games, which I agree with, but I put it lower because it's less critical of the husband's behavior. Statement 8 is also less critical, as it only calls the husband cheap and cowardly. Statement 4 implies that the husband is testing the wife's willingness to pay for meals, which I think is a valid point, but I put it last because it's less critical of the husband's behavior."

I strongly agree with statement 10, which suggests that this behavior is a red flag and the relationship should be reconsidered. Statement 9, stating that the wife is enabling this behavior by not addressing it directly, is also a concern (statement 9).

I agree with statement 1, as the husband's actions can be seen as manipulative and a game to avoid paying for meals. Statement 5, suggesting that both adults should be able to discuss this without playing games, aligns with my view. Statement 3, stating that it's reasonable to split costs 50/50, but his methods are weird, is something I can see as a possibility. Statement 2, suggesting an open conversation about splitting costs, is also a reasonable suggestion. Statement 9, stating that the wife is enabling his behavior by not addressing it directly, is something I can see as a potential issue. Statement 4, stating that the husband is trying to see if the wife is willing to pay for meals without him asking directly, is a possibility but I don't see it as a justification for his actions. Statement 7, suggesting reevaluating the relationship, is a bit extreme based on the information provided. Statement 8, stating that the husband is being cheap and cowardly, is not something I agree with as the issue seems to be more about respect and honesty.

Statement 5 also suggests having an open conversation, but it is less liked because it implies that both parties are at fault. Statement 3 agrees with the idea of splitting costs 50/50, but it is less liked because the husband's methods are weird. Statement 1 highlights the husband's manipulative behavior, which I agree with, but it is less liked because it does not directly address the issue of fun money.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I am questioning the husband's behavior and motives regarding the refusal to let his wife spend his money on her best friend. I am particularly interested in the respect and honesty aspect of the situation. Therefore, I agree with statement 6 the most, which highlights the importance of respect and honesty in the relationship.

Statement 1 also aligns with my perspective, as it suggests that the husband's behavior is manipulative and a game-playing tactic. Statement 3 resonates with me as well, as I believe that splitting costs 50/50 is reasonable, but the husband's methods are questionable.

Statement 5 emphasizes the importance of open communication, which I also value. Statement 9 highlights the wife's role in enabling the husband's behavior, which I also mentioned in my comment.

Statements 2 and 4 suggest that the wife should address the issue directly, which I agree with, but they are not my top priority.

Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, which I also mentioned in my comment, but it is not the most important aspect of the situation for me.

Statement 8 criticizes the husband for being cheap and cowardly, which I do not necessarily agree with, as I do not have enough information about his financial situation or intentions.

Statement 10 suggests ending the relationship, which I find to be an extreme measure based on the information provided. Therefore, it is at the bottom of my list."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe the husband's behavior is a red flag and disrespectful, so I put statement 10 (This behavior is a red flag and you should consider ending the relationship.) at the top. Statement 6 (His behavior is not just about money, it's about respect and honesty.) and 7 (You should reevaluate the relationship if he's not willing to have an open conversation.) are also in line with my view, so they are ranked high. Statement 5 (You're both adults and should be able to discuss this without playing games.) is a reasonable expectation, so it's ranked high as well. Statements 9 (You're enabling his behavior by not addressing it directly.) and 2 (You should have an open conversation about splitting costs and not play games.) are similar in nature, but I put 9 before 2 because it's more critical of the wife's behavior. Statement 3 (It's reasonable to split costs 50/50, but his methods are weird.) and 4 (He's trying to see if you're willing to pay for meals without him asking directly.) are less critical, so they're ranked lower. Statement 8 (He's being cheap and cowardly by not being upfront about his intentions.) is similar to statement 1, but less severe, so it's ranked lower. Statement 1 (He's playing games to avoid paying for meals and it's manipulative.) is ranked last because it's the least critical statement in the slate."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe the husband's behavior is a red flag and the wife should consider ending the relationship (10). His behavior is not just about money, it's about respect and honesty (6), and this is a major issue that could indicate deeper problems in the relationship (7). The wife should reevaluate the relationship if the husband is not willing to have an open conversation (7), and she is enabling his behavior by not addressing it directly (9). I agree that both parties should be able to discuss costs openly (5, 2), but the husband's manipulative and cowardly behavior (1, 6, 8) is the most concerning issue. The husband's methods of testing the wife's willingness to pay for meals without asking directly (4) are also problematic, and his behavior is not reasonable (3)."

REASONING = Based on the comment, it is clear that the husband's behavior is a major issue in the relationship. Statement 10, which suggests ending the relationship, is the most agreed upon statement. Statement 6, which highlights the respect and honesty aspect, is also highly agreed upon. Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, which is also a logical conclusion. Statement 9 implies enabling the behavior, which is a valid point. Statement 5 suggests discussing the issue, which is a reasonable approach. Statement 2 suggests having an open conversation, which is a good idea but less preferred than discussing the issue directly. Statement 3 implies that splitting costs 50/50 is reasonable, but the husband's methods are not. Statement 1 implies that the husband is playing games, which is agreed upon but less severe than other statements. Statement 8 implies that the husband is being cheap, which is a valid point but less severe than other statements. Statement 4 implies that the husband is testing the wife's willingness to pay for meals, which is a less severe issue compared to other statements."

I also agree that the partner's methods for splitting costs are weird (statement 3) and that he is trying to see if the OP is willing to pay for meals without asking directly (statement 4). However, I believe that the OP and their partner should be able to have an open conversation about splitting costs (statement 2) and that the OP should not enable the behavior by not addressing it directly (statement 9). I think that statement 1 (he's playing games to avoid paying for meals and it's manipulative) is the least liked because it is not as serious as the other statements and it is not as directly related to the issues in the relationship."

Statement 2, ""Well, you should have an open conversation about splitting costs and not play games,"" and statement 7, ""You should reevaluate the relationship if he's not willing to have an open conversation,"" both suggest solutions for the situation. Statement 10, ""This behavior is a red flag and you should consider ending the relationship,"" is the least liked statement because it suggests a drastic solution without fully understanding the dynamics of the relationship. Statement 8, ""He's being cheap and cowardly by not being upfront about his intentions,"" is also less liked because it oversimplifies the situation and focuses solely on the husband's financial behavior."

I have 0 problem paying for food after he has paid for the previous meal but he doesn’t even let me offer and imposes a sort of avoidable situation at me as to why he can’t pay for the particular meal and i have to pay for it.

then after 3 hours, he said “babe you’ll have to order food today, i’m out of energy”, i expected that from a mile away. and he was fully expecting me to pay for his $30 each burger when he came up with that lame excuse. to test that theory out, i said “im tired too, not in the mood to eat”. lie. right after i said that, he was literally not the same person anymore. he was full of energy and even told me to stay awake, “the night has just started”.

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe the boyfriend's behavior is a red flag and disrespectful, so I agree with statements 10, 6, 7, 9, which strongly criticize his actions. Statement 2 suggests having an open conversation, which I agree with but place lower because the boyfriend's behavior indicates he may not be willing to have a reasonable discussion. Statements 5, 3, and 4 imply that both parties should discuss and split costs fairly, which I agree with but place lower because the boyfriend's actions are more concerning. Statement 1 is the least liked because it downplays the boyfriend's manipulative behavior by focusing only on his attempts to avoid paying."

Statement 3 is ranked sixth because it acknowledges that splitting costs 50/50 is reasonable, but his methods are not. Statement 9 is ranked seventh because it suggests that the OP is enabling his behavior, which is true. Statement 1 is ranked eighth because it identifies his behavior as manipulative, which is a valid point.

Statement 4 highlights the boyfriend's intentions, but I don't think it's the most important aspect of the situation. Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, but I don't think it's necessary at this point. Statement 10 is the most extreme statement and I don't believe it's warranted based on the information provided.

REASONING: Based on the comment, the boyfriend's behavior is not just about money, but also about respect and honesty (statement 6). The boyfriend's actions are manipulative and a red flag, which could lead to ending the relationship (statements 1 and 10). The OP should address the issue directly and reevaluate the relationship if necessary (statements 9 and 7). Both parties should have an open conversation without playing games (statements 2, 5, and 9). The boyfriend's behavior is not only cheap, but also cowardly (statement 8). The OP is enabling the behavior by not addressing it directly (statement 4). The statements are ordered from most agreed upon (6) to least agreed upon (8) based on the comment and slate."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that both the OP and her boyfriend are acting immaturely and disrespectfully. Therefore, statement 10, which suggests ending the relationship due to this behavior, is ranked the highest. Statement 6, which highlights the issue of respect and honesty, is also highly ranked. Statement 7, which advises reevaluating the relationship, is ranked similarly. Statement 5, which emphasizes the importance of open communication, is ranked next, followed by statement 9, which suggests that the OP is enabling her boyfriend's behavior. Statement 2, which recommends having an open conversation about splitting costs, is ranked lower because it does not address the underlying issues of respect and communication. Statement 3, which acknowledges the reasonableness of splitting costs 50/50, is ranked similarly. Statement 4, which speculates about the boyfriend's intentions, is ranked lower. Statement 1, which labels the boyfriend's behavior as manipulative, is ranked last because it oversimplifies the issue and does not acknowledge the OP's role in enabling the behavior. Statement 8, which calls the boyfriend cheap and cowardly, is also ranked last because it is overly critical and does not contribute to a productive conversation."

I strongly agree with statement 10 as it highlights the red flag behavior. Statement 7 also aligns with my comment, emphasizing the need to reevaluate the relationship. Statement 6 highlights the respect and honesty aspect, which I also mentioned in my comment. I agree with statement 9, as enabling the behavior is not a good sign. Statements 5, 3, and 2 suggest having an open conversation, which I agree with but to a lesser extent, as the boyfriend's methods are manipulative and not straightforward. Statement 1 highlights the manipulative aspect, which I agree with. Statement 8 points out the boyfriend's cheapness, which I also mentioned in my comment, but I rank it lower as it is not the main concern. Statement 4, while reasonable, is ranked last as it does not address the manipulative and disrespectful behavior."

Therefore, I agree with statements 5, 6, 7, and 10, which emphasize the importance of open communication and addressing issues directly. I also agree with statements 2 and 3, which suggest that playing games and being cheap are not appropriate ways to handle financial matters. However, I disagree with statement 1, which implies that the boyfriend's behavior is manipulative, as there is not enough information in the post to support this claim. I also disagree with statements 4 and 8, which suggest that the boyfriend is being cheap and cowardly, as these statements are judgmental and do not contribute to a productive conversation. Finally, I ranked statement 9 last because it implies that the OP is enabling the boyfriend's behavior, which is not necessarily true, as the OP may not have realized the implications of their actions until reading the comments."

Statement 3 (It's reasonable to split costs 50/50, but his methods are weird.) and statement 4 (He's trying to see if you're willing to pay for meals without him asking directly.) are ranked lower because they are less critical of the boyfriend's behavior. Statement 5 (You're both adults and should be able to discuss this without playing games.) and statement 9 (You're enabling his behavior by not addressing it directly.) are ranked low because they suggest that the problem can be solved through communication, which I do not believe is the case given the red flags I have identified. Statement 2 (Well, you should have an open conversation about splitting costs and not play games.) is ranked the lowest because it implies that the problem is simply a lack of communication, which I do not believe is the case. Statement 8 (He's being cheap and cowardly by not being upfront about his intentions.) is ranked low because it focuses on the boyfriend's financial motivations, rather than the disrespect and manipulation I see as the core issue."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't believe the boyfriend is being malicious or trying to avoid paying for meals. However, I do agree that his behavior is about respect and honesty (6), and if he's not willing to have an open conversation about splitting costs (7), it's a red flag (10). I also think that both parties should be able to discuss this without playing games (5), and that the behavior is not just about money (6). I agree that the boyfriend's methods are weird (3), but I don't think he's playing games to avoid paying for meals (1) or being cheap and cowardly (8). I do think that the behavior is a red flag (10), but I don't think the OP should reevaluate the relationship yet (7). I also think that the OP is enabling the behavior by not addressing it directly (9), and that the boyfriend is trying to see if the OP is willing to pay for meals without him asking directly (4). I put the statement ""Well, you're both adults and should be able to discuss this without playing games"" (2) last because I think it's the least important statement, as it's already been said in a more specific way earlier in the list."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe the boyfriend's behavior is a red flag and the OP should consider ending the relationship. I agree with statement 10 the most, followed by statements 6 and 7, which also highlight the disrespectful and manipulative nature of the boyfriend's behavior. Statement 9 suggests that the OP is enabling his behavior, which I also agree with. Statements 2, 5, and 3 suggest that both parties should have an open conversation about splitting costs, but the boyfriend's methods are not appropriate. Statements 1 and 4 acknowledge the boyfriend's manipulative behavior, but I believe the situation is more severe and requires a stronger response. Statement 8 criticizes the boyfriend for being cheap, but I think the issue goes beyond just money and is about respect and honesty."

Statement 6 aligns with my view that his behavior is about respect and honesty, not just money. Statement 7 suggests reevaluating the relationship, which I agree with. Statement 9 implies enabling his behavior, which I also agree with. Statement 2 suggests having an open conversation, but the boyfriend is manipulative and not willing to have an open conversation, so it's lower in the ranking. Statement 5 suggests both adults should be able to discuss this, which is ideal but not the case here. Statement 3 is reasonable but not fully addressing the issue. Statement 4 is close to statement 1 but less direct. Statement 1 is the least liked because it implies playing games, which is not the main issue here. Statement 8 is about him being cheap and cowardly, which is true but less important than the respect and honesty aspect."

Statement 4 implies that he's trying to see if the OP is willing to pay for meals without him asking directly, which I don't fully agree with as I think he's being more manipulative than that.

Statements 2, 5, and 3 are ranked lower as they suggest having a conversation about splitting costs, which is a reasonable expectation but does not address the underlying disrespectful behavior. Statement 1 is ranked low as it implies the boyfriend is intentionally playing games to avoid paying for meals, which is a serious concern. Statement 4 is ranked last as it suggests the boyfriend is testing the OP, which is less concerning than the other statements.

Statement 7 focuses on the development of a growth mindset, which is a positive outcome of redoing assignments. Statement 6 emphasizes the importance of helping the child learn from their mistakes, which is in line with my comment. Statement 10 highlights the potential for redoing assignments to develop personal responsibility and accountability, which is also in line with my comment.

Statement 9 emphasizes the importance of understanding why the child made mistakes, which is not directly opposed to my comment but places less emphasis on the importance of redoing assignments.

The fourth statement also aligns with my perspective, as the child might not have understood the assignment or the material, and redoing it can help them learn. The third statement is in line with my comment, where redoing the assignment can be seen as a way to teach the child to take responsibility for their work, but it can also be presented as a punishment. The second statement is something I can agree with, as the goal of education is not just to complete assignments, but to understand the material. The seventh statement resonates with my view, as redoing the assignment can help the child develop a growth mindset and learn from their failures. The tenth statement is in line with my perspective, as redoing the assignment can be a way to help the child develop a sense of personal responsibility and accountability for their work. The sixth statement is in line with my opinion, as the focus should be on helping the child learn from their mistakes, rather than just redoing the assignment. The fifth statement, while positive, is not as important as the others, as the child's decision to redo the assignment on their own shows maturity, but it is not necessary for the child's learning. The ninth statement is not a priority for me, as understanding why the child made mistakes is important, but it is not as crucial as helping them learn from their mistakes. The eighth statement is the least important, as the child's teacher may not have required them to redo the assignment, so it's not necessary for the parents to enforce it."

Redoing the assignment can be a way to help them learn (4, 1), but it's not necessary if the teacher didn't require it (8). The focus should be on helping the child learn, rather than just redoing the assignment (2). If the child chose to redo the assignment on their own, it shows maturity and a desire to learn (5), but forcing them to redo it can be seen as punishment (3). The goal of education is to understand the material (2), and redoing the assignment can help with that (1, 4, 7). Personal responsibility and accountability for their work are important for the child to develop (10)."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that forcing the child to redo the assignment is not an appropriate consequence, and it can be damaging to their perception of the value of their time and the fairness of consequences. I do agree that redoing an assignment can help a child learn from their mistakes and understand the material better, but I think it should be the child's decision to do so, not the parents'. I also think that it is important for the parents to understand why the child made mistakes in the first place, rather than just making them redo the assignment. Therefore, I have ranked statement 3 (Forcing a child to redo an assignment can be seen as punishment, but it can also be a way to teach them to take responsibility for their work) as the most liked, because it aligns with my belief that forcing the child to redo the assignment can be seen as punishment. I have ranked statement 4 (It's possible that the child didn't understand the assignment or the material, and redoing it can help them learn) as the second most liked, because it acknowledges the potential benefits of redoing the assignment. I have ranked statement 7 (Redoing the assignment can help the child develop a growth mindset and learn from their failures) as the third most liked, because it highlights the potential for personal growth that can come from redoing the assignment. I have ranked statement 6 (The focus should be on helping the child learn from their mistakes, rather than just redoing the assignment) as the fourth most liked, because it emphasizes the importance of learning from mistakes. I have ranked statement 1 (Redoing poor work helps children learn from mistakes and understand concepts) as the fifth most liked, because it aligns with the potential benefits of redoing the assignment. I have ranked statement 2 (The goal of education is not just to complete assignments, but to understand the material) as the sixth most liked, because it highlights the importance of understanding the material, rather than just completing assignments. I have ranked statement 5 (The child's decision to redo the assignment on their own, despite their father's help, shows maturity and a desire to learn) as the seventh most liked, because it acknowledges the child's autonomy and desire to learn. I have ranked statement 10 (The parents should try to understand why the child made mistakes in the first place, rather than just making them redo the assignment) as the eighth most liked, because it emphasizes the importance of understanding the root cause of the child's mistakes. I have ranked statement 9 (Redoing the assignment can be a way to help the child develop a sense of personal responsibility and accountability for their work) as the ninth most liked, because it suggests that redoing the assignment can be a way to teach the child responsibility, but I think it should be the child's decision to redo the assignment. I have ranked statement 8 (The child's teacher may not have required them to redo the assignment, so it's not necessary for the parents to enforce it) as the least liked, because it implies that the parents are overstepping their boundaries by enforcing the redoing of the assignment."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the child should do their own homework and learn from their mistakes. This aligns with statement 3, which suggests that redoing an assignment can teach a child to take responsibility for their work. Statement 4 also aligns with this idea, as it suggests that redoing the assignment can help the child learn the material. Statement 1 reinforces the idea that redoing poor work can help children learn from their mistakes. Statement 2, while not directly related to my comment, is still in line with the overall goal of education.

Statements 6 and 7 are also in line with my comment, as they suggest that redoing the assignment can help the child learn from their failures and develop a growth mindset. Statement 5, while not directly related to my comment, still promotes the idea of the child taking responsibility for their work. Statement 10 is in line with my comment as it suggests that redoing the assignment can help the child develop a sense of personal responsibility and accountability for their work.

Statement 9, while not directly related to my comment, suggests that the parents should try to understand why the child made mistakes in the first place. This is a good point, but it is not the focus of my comment. Statement 8, on the other hand, is not in line with my comment as it suggests that the child's teacher may not have required them to redo the assignment, so it's not necessary for the parents to enforce it.

In summary, I agree with statements that align with the idea of the child doing their own homework, learning from their mistakes, and taking responsibility for their work. I disagree with statements that suggest that redoing the assignment is not necessary or that the focus should be on understanding why the child made mistakes rather than making them redo the assignment."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I agree that the parents are not the asshole for making their son redo the assignment. I also agree that redoing the assignment can help the child learn from their mistakes, understand the material, and develop a growth mindset (1, 4, 6, 7). Additionally, I think that it can help the child take responsibility for their work and develop a sense of personal accountability (3, 10). However, I disagree with the idea that forcing the child to redo the assignment can be seen as punishment (2). Instead, the focus should be on helping the child learn from their mistakes and understand the instructions (3, 6, 10). I also think that it's important for the parents to try to understand why the child made mistakes in the first place, rather than just making them redo the assignment (9). The statement about the child's decision to redo the assignment on their own shows maturity, but it's not relevant to the situation since the parents are the ones requiring the child to redo it (5). Finally, I think that whether or not the child's teacher required them to redo the assignment is not relevant to the parents' decision to have the child redo it (8)."

At least, based on my (admittedly possibly overreaching) inferences from one paragraph, of the available options, this best describes you.

So, your husband, who is ""amazing"" at science, ""helped"" your son, but your son, rather than turn in the presumably correct assignment that your husband ""helped"" him on, did a new version by himself and turned that in. Did it occur to you at all to wonder why that is? Why did he ignore a perfectly good project and make an inferior version from scratch? Sounds to me that your son would rather get a poor grade on work that he did himself than get a good grade on something your husband did. That shows maturity on his part, and is a red flag to me as far as you and your husband. 

If your husband's ""help"" results only on your son having a finished output that is good, but doesn't result in your son being able to create a good finished output on his own, then how exactly is your husband helping him? The purpose of homework isn't the output, it's the learning. You've been in education for 20 years and you don't understand that?

What exactly do you think redoing it will involve? Do you think he deliberately did a poor job, and he will somehow magically do a better job the next time if you just ask him to do it again? Do you think telling him that what he did wasn't right will somehow make him know what \*is\* right? My guess is he's just going to feel pressured to copy the version that his dad ""helped"" him on so you can pretend that he's actually learning.

You really need to take a good hard look at how you and your husband are approaching your son's education. Your son is not learning the subject matter, and rather than addressing that, you are addressing the symptoms. Your post doesn't have any discussion of what you're doing to try to figure out why your son isn't learning, or trying to figure out how to address the fact that he isn't learning.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I agree that redoing the assignment is not a negative action and can be helpful for the child's learning. Therefore, I put statement 1 (Redoing poor work helps children learn from mistakes and understand concepts.) as the most liked. Statement 3 (Forcing a child to redo an assignment can be seen as punishment, but it can also be a way to teach them to take responsibility for their work.) and statement 4 (It's possible that the child didn't understand the assignment or the material, and redoing it can help them learn.) are also in line with my perspective, so I put them next. Statement 2 (The goal of education is not just to complete assignments, but to understand the material.) is not in direct opposition to my viewpoint, but I prioritize the practical aspect of learning from mistakes over the theoretical goal of education. Therefore, I put it after the previous statements. Statement 7 (Redoing the assignment can help the child develop a growth mindset and learn from their failures.) and statement 6 (The focus should be on helping the child learn from their mistakes, rather than just redoing the assignment.) are similar to statement 1, so I put them next. Statement 10 (Redoing the assignment can be a way to help the child develop a sense of personal responsibility and accountability for their work.) is also in line with my perspective, so I put it after the previous statements. Statement 5 (The child's decision to redo the assignment on their own, despite their father's help, shows maturity and a desire to learn.) is not directly related to my perspective, so I put it after the previous statements. Statement 9 (The parents should try to understand why the child made mistakes in the first place, rather than just making them redo the assignment.) is not in direct opposition to my perspective, but I prioritize the practical aspect of learning from mistakes over understanding the root cause of the mistakes. Therefore, I put it after the previous statements. Statement 8 (The child's teacher may not have required them to redo the assignment, so it's not necessary for the parents to enforce it.) is the least liked statement because it implies that the parents should not intervene in the child's learning process, which contradicts my perspective that redoing the assignment can be helpful for the child's learning."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that redoing the assignment can be beneficial for the child's learning and development. Statement 1 aligns with this belief, as it highlights the importance of learning from mistakes. Statement 2 also aligns with this belief, as it emphasizes the importance of understanding the material rather than just completing assignments. Statement 4 reinforces the idea that redoing the assignment can help the child learn. Statement 3 and 7 emphasize the importance of personal responsibility and accountability, which I also believe is important. Statement 6 focuses on helping the child learn from their mistakes, which I agree with. Statement 5, while positive, is less relevant to the importance of redoing the assignment. Statement 10, while also positive, is less important than the other statements. Statement 9 focuses on understanding why the child made mistakes, which is important but not as important as the other statements. Statement 8 is the least important, as it suggests that redoing the assignment may not be necessary if the teacher did not require it."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that it's important for children to take responsibility for their work and learn from their mistakes. Therefore, I agree with statement 3, ""Forcing a child to redo an assignment can be seen as punishment, but it can also be a way to teach them to take responsibility for their work."" I also agree with statement 10, ""The parents should try to understand why the child made mistakes in the first place, rather than just making them redo the assignment,"" because understanding the root cause of the mistakes can help the child learn better.

Statement 4, ""It's possible that the child didn't understand the assignment or the material, and redoing it can help them learn,"" aligns with my belief that redoing the assignment can help the child learn from their mistakes and understand the material better. Statement 1, ""Redoing poor work helps children learn from mistakes and understand concepts,"" and statement 7, ""Redoing the assignment can help the child develop a growth mindset and learn from their failures,"" also reflect this belief.

Statement 6, ""The focus should be on helping the child learn from their mistakes, rather than just redoing the assignment,"" is in line with my comment, as the goal is to help the child learn and grow. Statement 2, ""The goal of education is not just to complete assignments, but to understand the material,"" reinforces the importance of learning and understanding over just completing assignments.

Statement 5, ""The child's decision to redo the assignment on their own, despite their father's help, shows maturity and a desire to learn,"" is a positive outcome but not necessarily a requirement for redoing the assignment. Statement 9, ""The child's teacher may not have required them to redo the assignment, so it's not necessary for the parents to enforce it,"" suggests that the decision to redo the assignment should be left to the teacher, which I disagree with based on my belief in personal responsibility and accountability. Statement 8, ""Redoing the assignment can be a way to help the child develop a sense of personal responsibility and accountability for their work,"" aligns with my belief in personal responsibility and accountability, but it is not as strongly stated as statement 3."

However, it's important to understand the underlying reasons for the child's mistakes and focus on helping them learn from their failures (6, 2, 10). Additionally, while redoing the assignment can be beneficial, it should not be seen as a punishment (10). The child's decision to redo the assignment on their own shows maturity, but ultimately, the focus should be on understanding the material rather than just completing assignments (5, 2, 8).

Statement 7 highlights the development of a growth mindset, which I consider important. Similarly, statement 6 focuses on learning from failures, which I also find relevant. Statement 2, while less important, does touch on the idea that completing assignments is not the sole goal of education.

Statement 5, although positive, is less relevant to the situation, so it is placed lower in the order. Statement 10, while not incorrect, is not a primary concern in this scenario, so it is placed towards the end of the order. Statement 9 focuses on understanding the child's mistakes, which is important but less so than the other statements, and is placed accordingly.

Post,1gjy9l8,AITA for opening my husband’s package? ,pplplsrrrr,2024-11-05 04:10:10,"I (28) and my husband (30) just married earlier this year. Since we took our relationship to the next level, we decided to not renew our lease with our roommate and get our own spot. During the past 6 months of living together, just us two and my cat, I mostly get a ton of packages sent to our door. 

Whenever I place orders, especially through Amazon, I always give my husband a heads up. Not for any other reason. Yesterday, I gave him a heads up that I was ordering 3 things for my sibling. I was the first to get home today and noticed 3 packages. I ordered my sibling semi big things, and immediately opened up the boxes to wash before I head their way tonight. Shortly after opening the first box, I noticed a bright color that couldn’t have been what I ordered. I quickly checked the address, it was addressed to my husband, and I set it aside and continued to open the other 2 boxes. Somehow Amazon figured out a way to condense my order only into 2 packages. I thought nothing of it. 
My husband and I then had our daily ‘after-work’ phone call, where we discuss what happened throughout our days and he quickly threw out that he should have a package waiting for him. I then told him I accidentally opened it, but set it aside for him to completely open when he got home. 

The conversation then took a turn when he began to scold me about opening his packages. I reminded him of my order and explained to him that it wasn’t intentional. That I was just expecting my orders for my sibling and wanted to prepare their stuff before I gave it to them later. This explanation wasn’t good enough. 

My husband made it seem that I was being negligent, and that “common sense is to look at the address before opening any package or mail”. Although I agree with this, I don’t feel like it’s necessary when the packages are delivered to OUR door. I was expecting the package and opened it because I thought it was mine. I also feel since we are married, it shouldn’t matter that I opened the package on accident. It’s not like I took everything out. I simply took my key swiped it across the tape and noticed it wasn’t mine, and set it aside. 

After arguing in circles, his solution was for me to check every label before opening anything and my solution is a heads up after placing an order. I told him I’ll work on looking at the label, but he thinks it’s unnecessary to tell me when he’s expecting a package. We left the conversation annoyed at each other.

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable and it's how you respond that matters (5). Communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail (9) and checking the label before opening a package to avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy (1) are important, but I also think it's common sense to check the label even if the package is delivered to your home (2) and respecting each other's space and privacy is important in a relationship, even when it comes to packages (6). If you're expecting a package, it's best to communicate with your partner to avoid confusion (4) and if you're not sure who a package belongs to, it's best to set it aside and ask your partner before opening it (8). Marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages (3) and it's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation (10). I also think that it's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake (7) and the most that has happened in my experience is the opener says ""oops, sorry"" and the other one says ""that's okay"" and we move on (5)."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly agree that marriage doesn't mean having access to your partner's private mail and packages (statement 3). I also believe that respecting each other's space and privacy is important in a relationship, even when it comes to packages (statement 6), and communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail (statement 9). I agree that it's common sense to check the label before opening a package (statement 2) and that checking the label is necessary to respect the recipient's privacy (statement 1). I also think that if you're not sure who a package belongs to, it's best to set it aside and ask your partner before opening it (statement 8). I agree that opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable, but it's how you respond that matters (statement 5), and that it's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake (statement 7). I think it's best to communicate with your partner if you're expecting a package (statement 4), but I also believe that it's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation (statement 10)."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that both the OP and her husband are in the wrong for not respecting each other's privacy. Therefore, statement 3 (Marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages.) is the most agreed upon statement. Statement 6 (Respecting each other's space and privacy is important in a relationship, even when it comes to packages.) and 9 (Communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail.) are also highly agreed upon as they reflect the importance of communication and respect in a relationship. Statement 1 (Check the label before opening a package to avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy.) and 8 (If you're not sure who a package belongs to, it's best to set it aside and ask your partner before opening it.) are also agreed upon as they provide practical solutions to avoid opening someone else's package by mistake. Statement 5 (Opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable, but it's how you respond that matters.) is agreed upon as it highlights the importance of the response after a mistake is made. Statement 4 (If you're expecting a package, it's best to communicate with your partner to avoid confusion.) is agreed upon as it promotes communication. Statement 2 (It's common sense to check the label, even if the package is delivered to your home.) is agreed upon but to a lesser extent as it assumes common sense. Statement 7 (It's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake, but it's how you handle the situation that matters.) is agreed upon but it is less important than the other statements. Statement 10 (It's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, and it's how you respond that can make or break the relationship.) is the least agreed upon as it implies that one of the parties is overreacting."

I see all your comments. I understand that opening his package was wrong. I forgot to mention as part of the conversation, first thing I did was apologize.

Just set it aside for me, and he likes to open his own packages, which I totally get. I can’t stress enough that it was just a simple mistake. I didn’t read the label because I really thought it was mine. 

I do not open his packages on purpose or regularly. I don’t go through his phone. I don’t go into the bathroom when he’s shitting. Whatever else, I respect him and his privacy. 

A lot of you think I intentionally opened his package without remorse and just said fuck it. I can do what I want. We’re married.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the most important statement is that marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages (statement 3). This is because I mentioned in my comment that the husband was in the wrong for flipping out on the poster for opening his package, but also stated that it's common courtesy not to open someone else's mail. Statement 6, ""Respecting each other's space and privacy is important in a relationship, even when it comes to packages,"" aligns with this belief.

I also think it's common sense to check the label before opening a package (statement 1) and that it's a best practice to communicate with your partner if you're expecting a package (statement 4). These statements are important because they can help avoid confusion and mistakes in the first place.

Statement 10, ""It's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, and it's how you respond that can make or break the relationship,"" is important because it highlights the importance of how you respond to a situation.

Communication and mutual respect are crucial in avoiding conflicts, as stated in 9, which also supports my stance.

Statement 4, suggesting communication when expecting a package, is reasonable but less crucial than the aforementioned points. Statements 5 and 8, about setting the package aside and asking before opening, are valid suggestions but less critical than the main idea of respecting privacy. Statements 7 and 10, suggesting not to make a big deal or overreact, seem to downplay the significance of the violation of privacy and are thus ranked lower."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that the most important statement is that marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages (3). This is because the poster showed a lack of respect for their husband's privacy by opening his package without his consent. I also think that it is important to respect each other's space and privacy in a relationship (6), and that checking the label before opening a package is a simple way to avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy (1). I agree that it is common sense to check the label, even if the package is delivered to your home (2), and that communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail (9). I believe that it is not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake, but it is how you handle the situation that matters (7), and that if you're not sure who a package belongs to, it's best to set it aside and ask your partner before opening it (8). I also think that it's how you respond that matters, not just making an honest mistake (5), and that it's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation (10). I agree that if you're expecting a package, it's best to communicate with your partner to avoid confusion (4), but I rank it lower because it is less directly related to the poster's actions. I rank the statement that opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable (5) lower because it seems to downplay the importance of the invasion of privacy."

OP for not respecting her husband's opinion when he expressed what he wanted to happen. And as far as Amazon condensing the packages,  they tell tou they will do that when you check out. It says something like ""ship together to reduce trips to your house "".
Also, if OP haD looked at the name on the address prior to just opening the boxes she wouldve seen it was to him. If she wanted to know what he ordered she could've just set the package aside and asked him later what it was. 
My husband and I had seperate amazon accounts. We would tell each other when we expected a package. But we knew not to ask what it was unless it was already something we prior discussed before purchasing. i knew my husband ordered gifts for me from amazon. So I wouldnt open his packsges. Its a respect thing. 

And Husband for making a bigger deal out of it than necessary and scolding OP. All he had to do was say ""please just make sure you are opening the right package"" but I'm wondering if he actually scolded OP because of how OP treated it like it wasn't a big deal and seems to be offended that he was even upset. As women, we always want our spouses to respect our emotions. How about we respect our husband's emotions as well? All OP had to do was apologize for opening the package. Then both needed to discuss a plan for when more packages arrive instead of getting upset. 

OP says ""My husband made it seem that I was being negligent, and that “common sense is to look at the address before opening any package or mail”. Although I agree with this, I don’t feel like it’s necessary when the packages are delivered to OUR door.""

It IS common sense to look at the address before opening packages. What if the package was wrongly delivered? Like a neighbors package? GPS gets my address and my neighbors address wrong all the time. And a lot of times Amazon delivers her packages to my door. Even if she leaves instructions. Lol. 

 And OP agreeing with her statement to check the address, but then commenting like its not a big deal to check them is dismissing how her husband feels. 

""I also feel since we are married, it shouldn’t matter that I opened the package on accident.""

Again OP not respecting her husbands feelings on the matter. If it is a big deal to him then it needs to be a big deal to her and not just be dismissed. Accidents happen but it could've been avoided if she used common sense and had respect for her husband. 

""his solution was for me to check every label before opening anything and my solution is a heads up after placing an order. I told him I’ll work on looking at the label, but he thinks it’s unnecessary to tell me when he’s expecting a package.""

Why should he give a heads up about getting a package when all OP had to do was read the label and set the package aside.

Therefore, statement 1 and 2 are ranked high. Statement 3 emphasizes the importance of respecting each other's space and privacy, which aligns with my comment, so it is ranked next.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that opening someone else's package is a violation of their privacy, even if it was a mistake. Therefore, I agree with statement 3 the most, as it emphasizes the importance of respecting each other's space and privacy in a relationship, especially when it comes to packages. Statement 6 also aligns with my view, as it highlights the significance of respecting each other's privacy.

Statement 9 emphasizes the importance of communication and mutual respect, which I agree with, as it can help avoid conflicts over packages and mail. Statement 1 reinforces the need to check the label before opening a package, which is a common sense practice that I also agree with. Statement 2 further emphasizes the importance of checking the label, even if the package is delivered to your home.

Statement 8 suggests setting aside a package if you're not sure who it belongs to and asking your partner before opening it, which I agree with, as it shows respect for the other person's privacy. Statement 5 highlights that opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable, but it's how you respond that matters, which I agree with, as it's important to take responsibility for your actions.

Statement 4 suggests communicating with your partner if you're expecting a package, which I agree with, as it can help avoid confusion. Statement 7 states that it's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake, but it's how you handle the situation that matters, which I agree with, as it's important to take responsibility for your actions.

Finally, statement 10 suggests that it's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, which I agree with, but I believe that opening someone else's package without their permission is a violation of their privacy, and it's how you respond that matters."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I do not think the poster is TA, so I disagree with statement 3, which says that marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages. I agree with statement 6, which emphasizes the importance of respecting each other's space and privacy in a relationship, even when it comes to packages.

Statement 8, which suggests setting aside a package if you're not sure who it belongs to, is a reasonable approach. Statement 5, which focuses on how you respond after opening someone else's package, is less relevant since the poster opened the package unintentionally.

Statement 4, which recommends communicating with your partner when expecting a package, is less applicable here since the package was already delivered. Statement 2, which implies that opening someone else's package by mistake is not a big deal, contradicts my suggestion that the poster should start opening all of her husband's packages. Statement 7, which states that overreacting to a situation can make or break a relationship, is not directly related to the issue at hand.

Statement 6 is also important because respecting each other's space and privacy is crucial in a relationship. Statement 9 highlights the importance of communication and mutual respect in avoiding conflicts, which I also agree with.

Statements 1 and 2 reinforce the idea that checking the label before opening a package is necessary to avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy. While I agree with this, I prioritize the principle of not opening other people's mail without their consent over the importance of checking the label.

Statement 4 suggests that communicating with your partner about expected packages can help avoid confusion. While I agree that communication is essential, I don't think it's necessary to communicate about every package that might arrive.

Statement 5 highlights that it's understandable to open someone else's package by mistake, but it's how you respond that matters. While I agree that the response is important, I prioritize the initial act of not opening someone else's package without their consent.

Statement 8 suggests setting aside a package if you're not sure who it belongs to and asking your partner before opening it. While I agree that this is a good practice, I think it's less important than the principle of not opening someone else's package without their consent.

Statement 7 emphasizes that it's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake, but it's how you handle the situation that matters. While I agree that the response is important, I prioritize the initial act of not opening someone else's package without their consent.

Common sense dictates checking the label (2), and setting aside a package if unsure (8) are also reasonable actions. Responding appropriately after opening someone else's package by mistake (5) and not making a big deal out of it (7) are important in handling the situation. Lastly, I agree that it's possible to overreact to a situation (10), and it's crucial to respond in a way that can make or break the relationship."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I do not think the poster is an asshole for opening the package, but I do acknowledge that it's important to respect each other's space and privacy in a relationship (statement 3). I also agree that communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail (statement 9). I ranked statement 1 and 4 higher because they suggest ways to avoid making the same mistake in the future. I ranked statement 5 and 8 higher because they suggest that it's not necessary to make a big deal out of the situation, but it's important to handle it appropriately. I ranked statement 2 and 7 lower because they seem to imply that the poster overreacted, which I do not believe is the case based on the information provided. I ranked statement 10 last because it suggests that the poster may be too sensitive, which I do not think is the case based on the information provided."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the original poster (OP) is an asshole for opening their husband's package by mistake. I agree with statements that emphasize understanding and respect in handling the situation, such as statement 5, ""Opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable, but it's how you respond that matters."" I also agree with statement 9, ""Communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail.""

I disagree with statement 3, ""Marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages,"" because I believe that the OP made a mistake and did not intentionally invade their husband's privacy. I also rank statement 10, ""It's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, and it's how you respond that can make or break the relationship,"" last because I don't think the situation calls for a discussion about sensitivity or overreaction.

The rest of the statements fall in the middle of the ranking because they offer general advice about handling packages and mail, but they don't directly apply to the OP's situation. For example, statement 1, ""Check the label before opening a package to avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy,"" is a good practice, but it doesn't address the fact that the OP made an honest mistake. Similarly, statement 8, ""If you're not sure who a package belongs to, it's best to set it aside and ask your partner before opening it,"" is a good suggestion, but it doesn't apply to the OP's situation because they already opened the package.

Overall, I prioritize statements that emphasize understanding and respect in handling the situation, and I rank statements that criticize the OP or offer general advice about handling packages and mail lower."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that opening someone else's package by mistake is not a big deal, but it's important to respect each other's space and privacy in a relationship. Therefore, I agree with statement 3, which emphasizes that marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages. Statement 6 is also in line with my perspective, as it highlights the importance of respecting each other's space and privacy in a relationship. Statement 9 emphasizes the importance of communication and mutual respect in avoiding conflicts, which I also agree with.

Statements 2 and 1 both suggest that it's common sense to check the label before opening a package, which I don't necessarily disagree with, but I don't think it's as important as respecting each other's privacy. Therefore, I rank them lower than statements 3, 6, and 9. Statement 8 suggests setting the package aside and asking your partner before opening it, which is a reasonable approach, but I don't think it's as important as respecting each other's privacy.

Statement 5 suggests that it's understandable to open someone else's package by mistake, but it's how you respond that matters. I agree with this statement, but I rank it lower because I think it's less important than the other statements that emphasize respecting each other's privacy and communication.

Statement 4 suggests that it's best to communicate with your partner to avoid confusion, which I agree with, but I don't think it's as important as the other statements that emphasize respecting each other's privacy and communication.

Statement 7 suggests that it's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake, but it's how you handle the situation that matters. I agree with this statement, but I rank it lower because I think it's less important than the other statements that emphasize respecting each other's privacy and communication.

Statement 10 suggests that it's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, and it's how you respond that can make or break the relationship. While I agree that it's important to respond appropriately, I think it's less important than the other statements that emphasize respecting each other's privacy and communication.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that marriage does not give one partner access to the other's private mail and packages (statement 3). I also think that respecting each other's space and privacy is important in a relationship, even when it comes to packages (statement 6). Communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail (statement 9), which is why I agree with statement 1 about checking the label before opening a package to avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy. Statement 8, about setting aside a package and asking your partner before opening it, is also reasonable. However, I disagree with the idea that it's common sense to check the label (statement 2) or that it's necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake (statement 7). Instead, I believe that it's how you handle the situation that matters (statement 5). Statement 4, about communicating with your partner if you're expecting a package, is less important than the other statements in my opinion.

You  should have checked the label... But you are the A-H for not taking responsibility, and trying to shift the blame onto him. You don't need to check without a 'heads-up' when he orders something.  The fact that you 'don’t feel like it’s necessary when the packages are delivered to OUR door' is immaterial, because your husband disagrees, and it was HIS parcel. You can 'feel' however you want about your OWN parcels. Nowhere does it say you admitted to him that you were wrong or apologized. You just make excuses for why you were not wrong.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly agree with statement 3, which emphasizes that marriage does not mean having access to your partner's private mail and packages. I also agree with statement 6, which highlights the importance of respecting each other's space and privacy in a relationship. Statement 1 is logical, and I agree that checking the label before opening a package can help avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy. Statement 2 aligns with my view that it is common sense to check the label, even if the package is delivered to your home. Statement 4 emphasizes the importance of communication, which I also mentioned in my comment.

I agree with statement 5, which notes that opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable, but it's how you respond that matters. However, I rank it lower because it doesn't directly address the issue of respecting privacy. Statement 8 is similar to statement 1, but I rank it lower because it focuses on setting the package aside instead of checking the label.

Statement 9 emphasizes the importance of communication and mutual respect, which I agree with, but I rank it lower because it doesn't specifically address the issue of privacy. Statement 7 suggests that it's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake, but I rank it lower because it doesn't address the importance of respecting privacy.

Finally, statement 10 suggests that it's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, and it's how you respond that can make or break the relationship.

Therefore, statement 3, ""Marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages,"" is the most agreed upon statement. Statement 6, ""Respecting each other's space and privacy is important in a relationship, even when it comes to packages,"" is also highly agreed upon, as it reinforces the idea that the poster violated her husband's privacy. Statement 1, ""Check the label before opening a package to avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy,"" and statement 2, ""It's common sense to check the label, even if the package is delivered to your home,"" are also agreed upon, as they highlight the importance of checking labels before opening packages. Statement 4, ""If you're expecting a package, it's best to communicate with your partner to avoid confusion,"" is agreed upon to a lesser extent, as it implies that the poster and her husband should have communicated about the package. Statement 5, ""Opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable, but it's how you respond that matters,"" is agreed upon, as it acknowledges that mistakes happen but emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility for those mistakes. Statement 8, ""If you're not sure who a package belongs to, it's best to set it aside and ask your partner before opening it,"" is agreed upon, as it provides a solution for avoiding mistakes in the first place. Statement 9, ""Communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail,"" is agreed upon, as it highlights the importance of communication in a relationship. Statement 10, ""It's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, and it's how you respond that can make or break the relationship,"" is agreed upon to a lesser extent, as it implies that the husband may be overreacting. Statement 7, ""It's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake, but it's how you handle the situation that matters,"" is the least agreed upon, as it implies that the situation is not a big deal, which contradicts my comment."

I believe that it's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, and it's how you respond that can make or break the relationship (statement 10). I disagree with the idea that it's not a big deal to open someone else's package, as it's important to respect their privacy and space (so statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 are ranked lower than the others)."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the poster is the asshole for opening her husband's package without his consent. Therefore, statement 3, which emphasizes that marriage does not mean having access to your partner's private mail and packages, is the most agreed upon statement. Statement 6, which highlights the importance of respecting each other's space and privacy in a relationship, is also highly agreed upon. Statement 9, which emphasizes the importance of communication and mutual respect in avoiding conflicts, is also agreed upon. Statement 1, which advises checking the label before opening a package, is agreed upon but less so than the previous three statements because it does not directly address the issue of privacy. Statement 8, which advises setting aside a package and asking the partner before opening it if unsure, is agreed upon but less so than statement 1 because it assumes that the poster is willing to communicate and respect her husband's privacy. Statement 5, which emphasizes that how one responds to opening someone else's package matters, is agreed upon but less so than statement 8 because it assumes that the poster has already made a mistake. Statement 4, which advises communicating with one's partner to avoid confusion, is agreed upon but less so than statement 5 because it assumes that the poster is willing to communicate. Statement 2, which downplays the significance of checking the label, is agreed upon the least because it does not address the issue of privacy. Statement 7, which suggests that making a big deal out of opening someone else's package is unnecessary, is agreed upon the least because it assumes that the poster has already made a mistake and is overreacting. Statement 10, which suggests that it is possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, is agreed upon the least because it implies that the poster's reaction is unwarranted."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that the situation described in the post did not happen and is fabricated. However, if we were to analyze the statements from a general perspective, I would order them from most liked to least liked as follows:

3: Marriage doesn't mean you have access to your partner's private mail and packages. - This statement is the most important one as it highlights the importance of privacy and respect in a relationship.

6: Respecting each other's space and privacy is important in a relationship, even when it comes to packages. - This statement reinforces the idea that privacy is crucial in a relationship.

9: Communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail. - Communication is essential in any relationship, and this statement emphasizes its importance in avoiding conflicts.

1: Check the label before opening a package to avoid mistakes and respect the recipient's privacy. - This statement is important as it highlights the need to be careful and respectful when handling other people's packages.

4: If you're expecting a package, it's best to communicate with your partner to avoid confusion. - Communication is essential in avoiding misunderstandings and conflicts.

8: If you're not sure who a package belongs to, it's best to set it aside and ask your partner before opening it. - This statement emphasizes the importance of being cautious and respectful when handling other people's packages.

5: Opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable, but it's how you respond that matters. - This statement highlights the importance of responding appropriately when mistakes are made.

7: It's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake, but it's how you handle the situation that matters. - This statement reinforces the idea that the response to a mistake is more important than the mistake itself.

2: It's possible to be too sensitive or overreact to a situation, and it's how you respond that can make or break the relationship. - While this statement is true, it is less important than the others as it focuses on the response rather than the initial action.

10: It's not necessary to make a big deal out of opening someone else's package by mistake. - This statement is the least important one as it downplays the importance of respecting other people's privacy and property."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that marriage does not give one access to their partner's private mail and packages (statement 3). I also think that respecting each other's space and privacy is important in a relationship, even when it comes to packages (statement 6). Communication and mutual respect are key in avoiding conflicts over packages and mail (statement 9), which is why checking the label before opening a package is important (statement 1). If there is still confusion about the package, it's best to set it aside and ask your partner before opening it (statement 8). Opening someone else's package by mistake is understandable, but it's how you respond that matters (statement 5). While it's not necessary to make a big deal out of the situation, it's important to respect your partner's privacy (statement 7). Statement 4, which suggests communicating with your partner about expected packages, is also important but comes after checking the label and setting it aside. Statements 2 and 10, which suggest that overreacting to the situation can break the relationship, are the least relevant to my stance."
Post,1gjyyhu,AITA for Not Sharing My Family’s Pasta Sauce Recipe with My Friend?,AreaNo6163,2024-11-05 04:50:05,"

I (28F) have this old family recipe for pasta sauce that’s been passed down for generations. My mom taught me when I was a kid, and over time, it’s become “my thing.” I make it for all sorts of occasions—birthdays, family gatherings, and even just nights in with friends. Everyone raves about it, and I take a lot of pride in keeping it close to the original.

One of my closest friends, Emily, recently asked me for the recipe. She’s been experimenting in the kitchen lately and thought it would be fun to try making it herself. At first, I kind of laughed it off, saying something like, “Oh, maybe I’ll teach you someday,” but she kept pressing. Emily isn’t Italian and doesn’t have a lot of experience cooking from scratch, so I was a little hesitant. It felt weird giving away something that feels so tied to my family, especially since my mom always treated it as a bit of a “family-only” thing.

I tried explaining that it was a family recipe, and I didn’t feel comfortable giving it out. She got pretty annoyed, saying it was just sauce and not some “huge family heirloom.” She pointed out that I’d shared recipes with her before (which is true, but those were random ones I found online, not family recipes).

Now things are awkward between us. She’s been short with me ever since and even made a snarky comment at a dinner party about how I “gatekeep sauce.” A few mutual friends think I should’ve just given it to her to avoid drama, but others understand why I wanted to keep it private.

Family recipes typically stay within the family, passing down from generation to generation.  Having something unique, and getting lots of compliments on it, are the reason they are well kept secrets.  Otherwise, if anyone could get the recipe, it wouldn't hold the same meaning of family pride!

REASONING = Based on my comment, I agree that family recipes are meant to be kept within the family and passed down through generations (1). I also agree that the poster is under no obligation to share their recipe (5, 9), and that saying ""it's a family recipe and I don't feel comfortable sharing it"" should have been the end of the request (5). I also think that if Emily doesn't want to share a recipe, she shouldn't make it for others (9). I disagree with the idea that gatekeeping recipes is petty and immature (3, 10), and that recipes are not intellectual property and should not be treated as such (8). I also think that the comment ""she's not Italian"" was rude and unnecessary (6). I can see how sharing recipes can help spread love and family legacy (7), but I still think that the poster is not obligated to share. I also think that saying no to sharing a recipe is a valid decision that people should respect (5). I understand that some people may see recipe sharing as a way to show love and appreciation (2, 7), but I still think that the poster has the right to keep their recipe private. I also think that the ""drama"" could have been avoided if Emily had not made a big deal about the recipe request (2). I also think that maintaining power and control through recipe gatekeeping is not a valid reason (10). I also think that recipes are meant to be shared and enjoyed, but I still think that family recipes hold a special meaning and should be kept within the family (4)."

Statement 10, ""Gatekeeping recipes can be seen as a way to maintain power and control,"" is a more negative interpretation of the situation, but it's not completely unfounded. Statement 1, ""Family recipes are meant to be kept within the family and passed down through generations,"" is a traditional view, but it doesn't necessarily mean that sharing a recipe is wrong. Statement 7, ""Sharing recipes can help spread love and family legacy,"" is a positive sentiment, but it's not directly relevant to the situation. Statement 8, ""Recipes are not intellectual property and should not be treated as such,"" is a more extreme interpretation of the situation, and it's not necessarily applicable here. Statement 4, ""Recipes are meant to be shared and enjoyed, not hoarded and kept secret,"" is a positive sentiment, but it's not necessarily relevant to the situation.

The ""she's not Italian"" comment was unnecessary and rude (statement 6), and while I believe that recipes should be shared and enjoyed (statement 4), I also recognize that family recipes are meant to be kept within the family (statement 1). I think people should respect the decision not to share a recipe (statement 5), but I also believe that sharing recipes can help spread love and family legacy (statement 7).

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly disagree with the original poster's (OP) decision to gatekeep the family pasta sauce recipe. Therefore, I have ranked statement 3 (Gatekeeping recipes is petty and immature) as the most agreed upon statement, followed by statement 10 (Gatekeeping recipes can be seen as a way to maintain power and control) as the OP's actions can be seen as a power move. Statement 9 (If you don't want to share a recipe, don't make it for others) is ranked next as it is a reasonable alternative to sharing the recipe. Statement 8 (Recipes are not intellectual property and should not be treated as such) is ranked next as it emphasizes the idea that recipes should not be hoarded. Statement 7 (Sharing recipes can help spread love and family legacy) is ranked next as it highlights the positive aspects of sharing recipes. Statement 2 (Sharing recipes is a way to show love and appreciation for others) and statement 4 (Recipes are meant to be shared and enjoyed, not hoarded and kept secret) are ranked next as they align with my belief that sharing recipes is a positive act. Statement 5 (It's okay to say no to sharing a recipe, and people should respect that decision) is ranked next as it is a valid point, but it does not justify the OP's actions. Statement 1 (Family recipes are meant to be kept within the family and passed down through generations) is ranked next as it is the OP's reasoning, but I still disagree with it. Statement 6 (The 'she's not Italian' comment was rude and unnecessary) is ranked last as it is unrelated to the main issue of recipe gatekeeping."

Additionally, if one does not want to share a recipe, they should not make it for others (Statement 9). Statement 1 aligns with my comment as family recipes can hold sentimental value and may not be meant to be shared. Statement 10 also aligns with my comment as gatekeeping recipes can be seen as a way to maintain power and control. Statement 3, while I do not fully agree, can be seen as a valid opinion as some may view withholding a recipe as petty and immature. Statement 6 aligns with my comment as the comment made about the friend not being Italian was rude and unnecessary. Statement 2, 7, and 8, while they promote sharing recipes, I do not fully agree as it is ultimately up to the individual to decide whether or not they want to share their recipe. Statement 4, I disagree with the most as recipes should not be forced to be shared and enjoyed, as it goes against the idea of keeping family recipes private and special."

Statement 5 is also in line with my perspective, as it supports the idea that one has the right to say no to sharing a recipe and people should respect that decision. Statement 9 agrees with my view that if you don't want to share a recipe, you shouldn't make it for others. Statement 3 and 10 are in contrast to my view, but I can see how some people might think that gatekeeping recipes is petty and a way to maintain power and control. Statement 2, 7, and 8 are less aligned with my view, as they suggest that recipes should be shared and enjoyed, and that sharing recipes can help spread love and family legacy. Statement 6 is the least aligned with my view, as it criticizes the comment ""she's not Italian"" which I don't think is relevant to the situation. Statement 4 is the second least aligned with my view, as it suggests that recipes are meant to be shared and enjoyed, not hoarded and kept secret, which goes against my belief that family recipes should be kept within the family."

Therefore, statements 3 and 6, which criticize the OP's behavior, are at the top of my list. Statements 7 and 4, which emphasize the importance of sharing recipes and the positive aspects of doing so, align with my viewpoint and follow closely. Statement 2, which suggests that sharing recipes is a way to show love, is also in line with my perspective. Statement 1, which views family recipes as something to be kept within the family, is less favored by me but still understandable to some extent. Statements 8 and 5, which argue that recipes should be shared and that it's okay to say no, are neutral to me. Statement 9, which suggests not making the recipe for others if you don't want to share it, is less agreeable but still reasonable. Statement 10, which views recipe gatekeeping as a way to maintain power and control, is the least agreeable to me as it seems like an overinterpretation of the situation."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that not sharing a pasta sauce recipe is not a big deal and that the person who posted the question is being overly sensitive. I agree with statement 3, ""Gatekeeping recipes is petty and immature,"" because I think that refusing to share a recipe in this situation is petty. I also agree with statement 7, ""Sharing recipes can help spread love and family legacy,"" because sharing recipes can be a way to share culture and traditions with others.

I partially agree with statement 4, ""Recipes are meant to be shared and enjoyed, not hoarded and kept secret,"" because while I think that sharing recipes can be a good thing, I also think that people should be able to choose whether or not they want to share their personal recipes. However, I disagree with statement 1, ""Family recipes are meant to be kept within the family and passed down through generations,"" because I don't think that recipes should be treated as secret family heirlooms.

I also agree with statement 8, ""Recipes are not intellectual property and should not be treated as such,"" because recipes are generally not protected by copyright law and should not be treated as if they are. I partially agree with statement 2, ""Sharing recipes is a way to show love and appreciation for others,"" because while sharing recipes can be a kind gesture, I don't think it is the only way to show love and appreciation.

I agree with statement 5, ""It's okay to say no to sharing a recipe, and people should respect that decision,"" because I think that the person who posted the question has the right to decide whether or not to share their recipe. I also agree with statement 9, ""If you don't want to share a recipe, don't make it for others,"" because I think that if someone is not willing to share a recipe, they should not make it for others.

I disagree with statement 6, ""The 'she's not Italian' comment was rude and unnecessary,"" because I don't think that the person who posted the question implied that their friend needed to be Italian to enjoy the pasta sauce.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I do not think the original poster (OP) is an asshole for not sharing their family's pasta sauce recipe. Therefore, I agree with statement 5, ""It's okay to say no to sharing a recipe, and people should respect that decision."" I also agree with statement 9, ""If you don't want to share a recipe, don't make it for others,"" because the OP has the right to choose what they want to share.

Statement 6, ""The 'she's not Italian' comment was rude and unnecessary,"" is ranked high because it is unrelated to the main issue of sharing the recipe. However, it is still important to acknowledge that the comment was inappropriate.

Statements 1 and 7, ""Family recipes are meant to be kept within the family and passed down through generations"" and ""Sharing recipes can help spread love and family legacy,"" are ranked high because they highlight the significance of family recipes. However, they do not necessarily mean that the OP is obligated to share their recipe.

Statement 2, ""Sharing recipes is a way to show love and appreciation for others,"" is ranked lower because it assumes that sharing recipes is always the best way to show love and appreciation. In this case, the OP has the right to choose how they want to express their love and appreciation.

Statement 10, ""Gatekeeping recipes can be seen as a way to maintain power and control,"" is ranked lower because it assumes that the OP's decision to not share their recipe is motivated by a desire for power and control. This is not necessarily true, as the OP may have other reasons for not sharing the recipe.

Statement 8, ""Recipes are not intellectual property and should not be treated as such,"" is ranked low because it assumes that the OP is treating the recipe as intellectual property. However, the OP has the right to keep their recipe private, just as they have the right to keep any other personal information private.

Statement 3, ""Gatekeeping recipes is petty and immature,"" is ranked last because it is a subjective judgment that is not necessarily true. The OP's decision to not share their recipe is not necessarily petty or immature, but rather a personal choice.

Statement 4, ""Recipes are meant to be shared and enjoyed, not hoarded and kept secret,"" is ranked last because it assumes that the OP is hoarding or keeping the recipe secret. However, the OP has the right to choose who they want to share the recipe with."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I agree that it is the family's right to keep the recipe private (1, 5). I also think the friend's behavior is weird and unnecessary (6, 9). I support the idea of sharing recipes as a way to show love, but it is not an obligation (2, 7). Recipes are not intellectual property, but they can still be kept private (8, 3). I disagree with the idea that gatekeeping recipes is inherently petty or controlling (4, 10)."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I don't think the original poster (OP) is an asshole for not sharing their family's pasta sauce recipe. Statement 5 aligns with my perspective, as it's okay to say no to sharing a recipe and people should respect that decision. Statement 9 also aligns with my view, suggesting that if the OP doesn't want to share the recipe, they shouldn't make it for others.

Statements 1 and 10 are somewhat agreeable, as they mention the idea of family recipes being kept within the family and not treating recipes as intellectual property. However, they don't fully reflect my stance, as I believe the OP has the right to withhold the recipe.

Statement 6 is partially agreeable, as the comment about the friend not being Italian was unnecessary and potentially contributed to the conflict. However, it doesn't directly relate to the OP's decision not to share the recipe.

Statements 2, 7, and 8 suggest that sharing recipes is a positive action, but they don't consider the possibility that someone might not want to share. I find these statements less agreeable because they don't take into account the OP's perspective.

Statement 3 is the least agreeable, as it labels the OP's actions as petty and immature. I disagree with this characterization, as the OP has the right to choose whether or not to share their family's recipe."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that if the family is not making any money from the recipe, then it is not unreasonable to share it. Therefore, I disagree with statement 1, which suggests that family recipes should be kept within the family. I also strongly agree with statement 8, which states that recipes are not intellectual property and should not be treated as such. I agree with statement 4, which states that recipes are meant to be shared and enjoyed, not hoarded and kept secret. I also agree with statement 7, which states that sharing recipes can help spread love and family legacy. However, I believe that the decision to share a recipe should be respected, so I agree with statement 5, ""It's okay to say no to sharing a recipe, and people should respect that decision."" I also agree with statement 6, ""The 'she's not Italian' comment was rude and unnecessary."" I agree with statement 9, ""If you don't want to share a recipe, don't make it for others."" However, I disagree with statement 3, which states that gatekeeping recipes is petty and immature. I think that if the recipe is not being sold, then it is not unreasonable to keep it within the family. I also disagree with statement 2, which states that sharing recipes is a way to show love and appreciation for others. I think that while sharing recipes can be a way to show love, it is not the only way and it is not necessary to share a recipe to show appreciation for someone. I also disagree with statement 10, ""Gatekeeping recipes can be seen as a way to maintain power and control."" I do not think that keeping a recipe within the family is a way to maintain power and control. Overall, I believe that if the family is not making money from the recipe, then it is not unreasonable to share it, but the decision to share should be respected."

I also agree with statement 1, which states that family recipes are meant to be kept within the family and passed down through generations, as it is the grandmother's recipe. However, I disagree with statement 10, which states that gatekeeping recipes can be seen as a way to maintain power and control, as it is not clear from the post that the recipe holder is doing so with the intention of maintaining power. I also disagree with statement 3, which states that gatekeeping recipes is petty and immature, as it is the decision of the recipe holder to share or not share. I also think that statement 6, which states that the 'she's not Italian' comment was rude and unnecessary, is not relevant to the main question of whether or not it is okay to not share the recipe. I agree with statements 2 and 7, which state that sharing recipes can be a way to show love and appreciation and can help spread love and family legacy, but I think that it is ultimately up to the recipe holder to decide whether or not to share. I also agree with statement 8, which states that recipes are not intellectual property and should not be treated as such, but I think that it is still the decision of the recipe holder to share or not share. I put statement 4 last because it is the most extreme statement, stating that recipes are meant to be shared and enjoyed, not hoarded and kept secret, which I do not think is necessarily true."

I agree with statements that suggest the OP should communicate their plans to their grandmother, but I do not think they need to provide excessive details or give an unreasonable amount of notice.

REASONING: The original poster (OP) is TA because they intentionally misled their friend about the length of their vacation, and they should have been more considerate of their friend's request to keep December and January open. I agree with statement 3 the most because the OP is taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity and then screwing her over by not giving her notice. Statement 9 is also high up because the OP is creating a problem for their grandmother and should take responsibility for their actions. Statement 1 is important because the OP should give their grandmother notice so she can make other arrangements for her house. Statement 6 is also crucial because the OP should let their grandmother know they're moving out as soon as possible. Statement 2 is lower because while the OP should show courtesy and let their grandmother know they're moving out, they don't necessarily need to give her details about their new place. Statement 5 is lower because being ungrateful and entitled is a result of not giving notice, not the primary issue. Statements 4 and 10 are lower because they are less important than giving notice and taking responsibility for one's actions. Statement 8 is last because while giving 30 days' notice is a standard courtesy, it's less important than taking responsibility for the problem the OP is creating for their grandmother.

I agree with statement 3 the most because the OP is indeed acting like a freeloader and taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity. Statement 9 is also high up in the ranking because the OP is creating a problem for their grandmother by not giving her notice and should take responsibility for their actions. Statement 1 is ranked high because the OP should give their grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements for her house. Statement 2 is ranked high because the OP has been living with their grandmother virtually rent-free for 7 years and should show some courtesy by letting her know they're moving out. Statement 5 is ranked high because the OP is being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating their grandmother's kindness and generosity over the years. Statement 4 is ranked lower because while the OP should treat their grandmother like any other landlord, the fact that they have been living with her for free for so long makes this situation different. Statements 6 and 10 are ranked lower because while the OP should let their grandmother know they're moving out and be honest with her, they don't have to give her details about their new place.

REASONING = In the original post, the commentator thought the poster was not the asshole (NTA) for not cancelling their vacation for their best friend's wedding. However, after finding out that the poster had booked a 16-day trip instead of a weekend trip, the commentator changed their stance to YTA (the poster is the asshole). The poster knew about their friend's wedding date and still booked a long trip, showing a lack of consideration for their friend's important day.

I also agree with statements 1 and 2, which suggest that the poster should have given their grandmother notice about their moving out. Statement 5, which mentions the poster's ingratitude and entitlement, is also relevant. Statement 4, which compares the grandmother to a stranger, seems a bit harsh, but it still implies that the poster should have given notice.

Therefore, I agree with statements that highlight the OP's lack of responsibility and gratitude towards their grandmother. Statement 3 is the strongest in expressing this view, followed by statement 9, which emphasizes the problem the OP is creating for their grandmother.

Statement 2 is less strong but still acknowledges the OP's lack of courtesy. Statement 4 and 5 are less relevant to my comment but still imply some level of responsibility towards the grandmother.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the person is taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity and not showing enough courtesy by not giving her notice before moving out. Therefore, I agree with statements 3 and 9 the most, as they highlight the person's irresponsible and entitled behavior. I also agree with statement 5, which points out the person's lack of appreciation for their grandmother's kindness.

Statements 1, 2, and 4 suggest that the person should give their grandmother notice before moving out, which I also agree with. However, I rank them lower than statements 3, 5, and 9 because they don't emphasize the person's lack of gratitude and entitlement as much.

Statement 6 is similar to statement 1, but I rank it higher because it emphasizes the urgency of the situation and the need for the person to take responsibility for their actions.

Statement 10 suggests that the person should be honest with their grandmother but doesn't specify how much notice they should give. I rank it lower because it doesn't address the main issue of the person's lack of consideration for their grandmother.

Statement 8 suggests that the person should give their grandmother 30 days' notice, which I agree with. However, I rank it lower because it doesn't emphasize the person's lack of gratitude and entitlement as much as the other statements.

Finally, statement 7 suggests that the person is not obligated to tell their grandmother about their personal life, which I disagree with. While the person may not be obligated to give details about their new place, they should at least let their grandmother know that they are moving out and not renting her house anymore. Therefore, I rank it last."

REASONING = Based on the comment, the poster is NTA and the grandmother seems to be unreasonable in expecting the poster to cancel their vacation and potentially disrupt their life for an indefinite period of time. Therefore, statements that criticize the poster for not giving notice or being ungrateful are ranked lower. The highest ranked statements are those that recognize the grandmother's behavior as unreasonable and the poster's actions as reasonable, such as statement 3 which calls the poster out for taking advantage of the grandmother's generosity. Statement 9 is ranked high because it acknowledges that the poster's actions will create a problem for the grandmother, but also recognizes that the poster should not be solely responsible for fixing it. Statements 1 and 2 are ranked higher because they suggest that the poster should give notice, but do not place blame on the poster for not doing so. Statements 6, 4, and 10 are ranked lower because they suggest that the poster should give more notice or details than is necessary. Statement 8 is ranked lower because it suggests a specific time frame for notice that may not be feasible in this situation. Statement 7 is ranked the lowest because it implies that the poster is not obligated to be honest with the grandmother, which is not in line with the overall sentiment of the comment."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly believe that the person is acting like a freeloader and taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity, so statement 3 is ranked the highest. Statement 9 follows closely as the person is creating a problem for their grandmother by not giving her notice and should take responsibility for their actions. Statement 1 is ranked next as the person should give their grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements for her house. Statement 6 is ranked next as the person should let their grandmother know they're moving out as soon as possible. Statement 2 is ranked next as the person has been living with their grandmother virtually rent-free for 7 years and should show some courtesy and let her know they're moving out. Statement 5 is ranked next as the person is being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating their grandmother's kindness and generosity over the years. Statement 4 is ranked next as the person should treat their grandmother like any other landlord and give her the same notice they would give to a stranger. Statement 10 is ranked next as the person should be honest with their grandmother and let her know they're moving out, but they don't have to give her details about their new place. Statement 8 is ranked next as giving 30 days' notice before moving out is a standard courtesy. Statement 7 is ranked the lowest as the person is not obligated to tell their grandmother about their personal life, but they should let her know they're not going to rent her house."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the OP is not obligated to cancel their vacation plans for their best friend's wedding, but they should have communicated their plans to their grandmother earlier. Therefore, I agree with statements that suggest the OP should inform their grandmother about their moving out plans as soon as possible (3, 9, 1, 2, 4, 6). I also think that the OP has been living with their grandmother for free for a long time and should show some courtesy (5, 9). However, I disagree with statements that suggest the OP is ungrateful or taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity (5). I believe that the OP should give their grandmother a standard notice of 30 days (8), but they are not obligated to share details about their new place (10, 7)."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the person is not taking responsibility for their actions and is being inconsiderate towards their grandmother. Therefore, I agree with statements 3 and 9, which highlight the person's lack of responsibility and inconsideration. Statement 1 is also in line with my comment as it suggests giving notice to the grandmother, which the person should have done. Statement 6 is similar to 1, but I ranked it lower because it only mentions letting the grandmother know as soon as possible, without specifying a time frame.

Statements 4 and 2 are similar in that they both suggest giving notice, but I ranked 4 higher because it mentions treating the grandmother like any other landlord, which is a more responsible approach. Statement 2 is ranked lower because it implies that the person has no obligation to give notice, which contradicts my stance.

Statement 5 is ranked low because it implies that the person is entitled and ungrateful, which may not be entirely accurate. Statement 10 is ranked lower because it suggests being honest with the grandmother, but does not emphasize the importance of giving notice.

Statements 8 and 7 are ranked the lowest because they suggest that the person is not obligated to give details about their new place or that they don't have to give notice about their personal life. These statements contradict my stance and suggest that the person is not taking responsibility for their actions."

REASONING: Based on the comment, the poster is considered the asshole (YTA) for not canceling their vacation for their best friend's wedding and forgetting about the two months they were asked to keep open. This shows a lack of consideration and responsibility towards their friend and their commitments.

In the given slate, statement 3 directly aligns with the comment, stating that the poster is acting like a freeloader taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity and then screwing her over. This is the strongest statement, as it reflects the same sentiment as the comment.

Statement 9 follows, as it mentions creating a problem for the grandmother by not giving her notice and taking responsibility for actions, which is what the poster failed to do in the given situation.

Statement 1 comes next, as it emphasizes giving the grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements for her house. This is a reasonable request, and the poster should have considered it.

Statement 6 follows, as it highlights the need to inform the grandmother as soon as possible so she can make other plans for her house. This is closely related to statement 1.

Statement 2 is placed next, as it points out that the poster has been living with the grandmother virtually rent-free for 7 years and should show some courtesy by letting her know they're moving out. Although this statement is not as strong as the previous ones, it still holds some weight.

Statement 5 follows, as it accuses the poster of being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating the grandmother's kindness and generosity over the years. While this may be true, it is not as directly related to the situation as the previous statements.

Statement 4 is placed next, as it suggests treating the grandmother like any other landlord and giving her the same notice that would be given to a stranger. This is a reasonable expectation, but it is not as strong as the earlier statements.

Statement 10 is placed after statement 4, as it emphasizes being honest with the grandmother but not necessarily providing details about the new place. This is a reasonable request, but it is less important than the earlier statements.

Statement 8 follows, as it suggests giving the grandmother 30 days' notice as a standard courtesy. This is a reasonable expectation, but it is not as directly related to the situation as the earlier statements.

Statement 7 is placed last, as it only mentions informing the grandmother about not renting her house and not giving details about the new place. This statement is the least important, as it does not address the main issue of not giving notice or considering the grandmother's situation."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe the OP is TA (the asshole) for booking a vacation during their friend's wedding weekend without considering the commitment they made as a maid of honor. This shows a lack of consideration and prioritization of their own desires over their friend's important day.

The first statement in the ordering is ""You're acting like a freeloader who's taking advantage of your grandmother's generosity and then screwing her over."" This is because the OP's actions towards their friend and their wedding are similar to the behavior described in this statement. They are prioritizing their own desires over the needs and commitments they have made to others.

The second statement in the ordering is ""You're creating a problem for your grandmother by not giving her notice, and you should take responsibility for your actions."" This is because the OP's lack of notice to their grandmother about moving out is causing problems for her, and they should take responsibility for their actions.

The third statement in the ordering is ""You should give your grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements for her house."" This is because giving notice is a standard courtesy and responsibility that the OP should follow, regardless of their personal relationship with their grandmother.

The fourth statement in the ordering is ""You should let your grandmother know you're moving out as soon as possible so she can make other plans for her house."" This is because the OP's lack of notice is causing problems for their grandmother, and they should let her know as soon as possible so she can make other arrangements.

The fifth statement in the ordering is ""You've been living with her virtually rent-free for 7 years, so you should show some courtesy and let her know you're moving out."" This is because the OP has been living with their grandmother for a long time without paying rent, and they should show some basic courtesy and consideration by letting her know they are moving out.

The sixth statement in the ordering is ""You're being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating your grandmother's kindness and generosity over the years."" This is because the OP's lack of consideration for their grandmother's needs and feelings shows a lack of appreciation for her kindness and generosity.

The seventh statement in the ordering is ""You should treat your grandmother like any other landlord and give her the same notice you would give to a stranger."" This is because the OP's lack of notice is a standard courtesy and responsibility that they should follow, regardless of their personal relationship with their grandmother.

The eighth statement in the ordering is ""You should be honest with your grandmother and let her know you're moving out, but you don't have to give her details about your new place."" This is because the OP should be honest with their grandmother about their plans, but they do not have to share personal details about their new place if they do not want to.

The ninth statement in the ordering is ""You should give your grandmother 30 days' notice before moving out as a standard courtesy."" This is because giving 30 days' notice is a standard courtesy that the OP should follow, regardless of their personal relationship with their grandmother.

The tenth statement in the ordering is ""You're not obligated to tell your grandmother about your personal life, but you should let her know you're not going to rent her house."" This is because the OP is not obligated to share personal details about their life with their grandmother, but they should let her know that they are not going to rent her house."

Statement 5 implies that the AITA is ungrateful, which is not directly related to the situation but still relevant, so it is ranked in the middle. Statements 4 and 10 suggest that the AITA doesn't need to disclose personal details, which is a valid point but not the main issue, so they are ranked low.

The OP was aware of the possible wedding dates and should have kept them in mind. Therefore, I agree with statements 3 and 9, which criticize the OP for being inconsiderate and creating a problem for their grandmother.

Statements 6 and 7 are less relevant to the situation, but I still rank them higher than 8 because they emphasize the importance of communication and taking responsibility for one's actions. Statement 10 is the least relevant because it suggests that the OP doesn't need to share details about their new place, but I still rank it higher than 8 because it acknowledges the need for honesty. Statement 8 is the least preferred because it suggests a minimum notice period, but it doesn't address the OP's lack of consideration for their grandmother's plans."

I do not agree with statement 8, which suggests giving the grandmother 30 days' notice, because it is not necessary and may not be feasible for the OP. I also do not agree with statement 2, which suggests that the OP should show courtesy by letting their grandmother know about their plans, because the OP has already asked their friend about their wedding plans before booking the vacation."

REASONING: Based on the comment, it seems like the person asking the question has already made up their mind about not cancelling their vacation and is looking for alternatives. The most disliked statement is therefore the one that implies they are taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity (3). The next most disliked statements are those that imply the person is being ungrateful or entitled (5, 9). After that, the statements that suggest the person should give their grandmother notice or be honest with her are ranked higher (1, 2, 6, 4, 8, 10). Finally, the statement that suggests the person is not obligated to share personal details with their grandmother is ranked the lowest (7), as it goes against the general theme of being respectful and considerate towards the grandmother."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the poster is the asshole here. However, I do agree that the poster should communicate their plans to their grandmother out of courtesy. I strongly disagree with statement 3, which accuses the poster of taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity. I also agree with statements 5 and 9, which emphasize the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions and being honest with the grandmother. I agree with statement 1 and 2, which suggest giving the grandmother notice, but I think they are less important than being honest and taking responsibility. I disagree with statement 6, which suggests letting the grandmother know as soon as possible, because I think it's more important to be honest and take responsibility than to rush the communication. I also disagree with statement 4, which compares the grandmother to a stranger, because the grandmother is not a stranger. I think statement 10 is the least important, because it suggests withholding details about the new place, which I don't think is necessary. I also think statement 7 is less important, because it suggests that the poster is not obligated to share personal details, but I think they should communicate their plans. I think statement 8 is the least important, because it suggests a specific time frame for giving notice, but I think the most important thing is to communicate honestly and take responsibility."

I also think that the OP should have communicated their plans to their grandmother earlier and shown some basic courtesy, as they have been living with her rent-free for 7 years.

I also agree with statements 1, 6, and 2, which suggest that the OP should have given their grandmother notice and shown some basic courtesy. Statement 5, which calls the OP entitled and ungrateful, is also in line with my opinion. I agree with statements 4 and 10 to a lesser extent, as they suggest that the OP should treat their grandmother like any other landlord, but I think the OP's behavior goes beyond that and is disrespectful. I agree with statement 8 to a lesser extent as well, as it suggests that the OP should give their grandmother 30 days' notice, but I think they should have communicated their plans earlier.

Statement 5 also implies that the OP is ungrateful, but I already expressed that sentiment in statement 3.

Statement 8 is ranked low because it suggests a specific time frame for giving notice, which may not be feasible or necessary in this situation. Statement 10 is ranked low because it suggests that the OP should be dishonest with their grandmother, which is not a good solution.

Finally, statement 7 is ranked last because it implies that the OP is not obligated to tell their grandmother anything about their personal life, which is a narrow and ungenerous interpretation of the situation."

Statement 5, which says that the person is being ungrateful and entitled, is partially true because they have been living rent-free for 7 years.

The slate statements reflect a range of opinions, from those who believe the poster should prioritize their grandmother's needs (1, 6, 4, 2, 5) to those who believe the poster should prioritize their own needs (3, 9, 10). I agree with the statements that suggest the poster is being inconsiderate and taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity (3, 9), and that they should take responsibility for their actions (9). I also agree that the poster should give their grandmother notice (1, 6, 4), but I don't think they are obligated to give details about their new place (10) or prioritize their grandmother's needs over their own (7). I disagree with the statements that suggest the poster is being ungrateful or entitled (5), as they have been living with their grandmother for 7 years and paying little to no rent. I also disagree with the statement that suggests the poster should treat their grandmother like any other landlord (4), as they have a personal relationship with her. I rank the statements in this order because I believe the poster has a responsibility to consider their grandmother's needs, but ultimately should prioritize their own needs and be honest with their grandmother about their plans."

REASONING = Based on the comment, it is important to consider the timeline of when the vacation was booked and the wedding date was given. If the vacation was booked without knowing the wedding date, then the commenter believes that the person in question (let's call them P) is not the asshole here. However, if P had a long period of time where they knew the wedding date but did not cancel the vacation, then they are acting irresponsibly and not showing basic courtesy to their grandmother. The commenter agrees with statements 3 and 9, which highlight P's lack of consideration for their grandmother. They also agree with statements 1, 6, and 2, which suggest that P should have communicated their plans to their grandmother as soon as possible. Statement 5 is also agreed upon, as P is being ungrateful for not appreciating their grandmother's kindness over the years. Statement 4 is partially agreed upon, as P should treat their grandmother like any other landlord, but the commenter believes that a 30-day notice is not enough in this situation. Statement 10 is partially agreed upon, as P should be honest with their grandmother but does not need to give details about their new place. Statements 7 and 8 are the least agreed upon, as the commenter believes that P has a responsibility to communicate their plans to their grandmother and take responsibility for their actions."

Statement 6 is next because the poster should let their grandmother know as soon as possible. Statement 4 follows because the poster should treat their grandmother the same as any other landlord. Statement 2 is next because the poster has been living there rent-free for 7 years. Statement 5 is next because the poster is being ungrateful for not appreciating their grandmother's kindness.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the poster is not the asshole in this situation. However, I do think that they have a responsibility to inform their grandmother about their plans in a timely and considerate manner. Statement 3 is the most in line with my perspective, as it implies that the poster has been taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity and should be more mindful of the impact of their actions. Statement 9 aligns with this perspective as well, emphasizing the importance of taking responsibility for creating a problem for the grandmother.

Statements 1, 6, and 4 all suggest that the poster should give their grandmother notice before moving out, which I agree with. However, I rank them lower than statements 3 and 9 because they don't explicitly acknowledge the poster's responsibility to be considerate of their grandmother's needs.

Statement 2 is less agreeable to me because it implies that the poster should inform their grandmother out of a sense of obligation, rather than as a matter of basic courtesy. Statement 5 is also less agreeable because it frames the poster's actions as ungrateful and entitled, which I don't think is entirely fair.

Statements 10, 8, and 7 are the least agreeable to me because they suggest that the poster doesn't need to be fully transparent with their grandmother about their plans. While I agree that the poster doesn't need to share personal details, I do think they have a responsibility to be honest about their intentions. Overall, my ranking reflects my belief that the poster should prioritize their grandmother's needs and be transparent about their plans, while also recognizing that they have the right to make their own decisions."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the poster is the asshole here. They have a life and are not obligated to cancel their vacation for their friend's wedding. However, I do agree that the poster should communicate their decision to their grandmother in a respectful manner. Statement 7 aligns with my perspective, as it acknowledges that the poster doesn't have to share personal details but should inform their grandmother about their plans. Statement 10 also resonates with my view, as it emphasizes the need for honesty without requiring excessive sharing of information.

Statements 8, 6, and 4 suggest giving the grandmother notice, which I agree with, but they are ranked lower because they imply a level of obligation that I don't fully support. Statement 9 is ranked lower because it places blame on the poster for creating a problem, which I don't think is entirely fair.

Statements 2, 5, and 3 are ranked the lowest because they imply that the poster is ungrateful, a freeloader, or entitled, which contradicts my belief that the poster is not the asshole in this situation. Statement 1 is ranked last because it suggests that the grandmother might need to find another tenant, which I think is an overreaction given the context."

It's wholly unreasonable to not secure a date and to expect people to effectively block out 5 months in anticipation of them getting their shit together.

Last friday my Wife and I took our 2 kids under 3 to the playground in our neighborhood park.  This was a rare Friday where there were no commitments as we usually take them first thing in the morning.    

As we approached we noticed there were probably a dozen kids there and 2 large labs running in the grassy area unleashed.  My wife and I are like the dogs shouldn't be there unleashed but our little guy was excited to be at the playground.  So we continued.  We let our boy run around and the younger one we put in the swing.  Some parents that were there started talking to us.  They are essentially one big neighborhood parent group and meet up weekly.  I didn't know anyone in this group.  

My son climbed a structure and went down a slide.  Once he was off the slide there were no kids on that structure.  A lady that had the 2 dogs there (I still don't know if she was a parent), let the dogs onto the playground structure and let them go down the slide.

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe the original poster (OP) is not the asshole (NTA) for standing up for their kids' safety. The OP has been living with their grandmother for 7 years without paying rent, so they should give her notice before moving out (3, 9, 5, 1, 2, 4, 6). The OP should be honest with their grandmother about their decision to move out, but they don't have to disclose details about their new place (10, 7). The OP should give their grandmother a standard 30-day notice (8) as a courtesy, but they are not obligated to treat their grandmother like a stranger (4) because they have a personal relationship. The OP is not creating a problem for their grandmother by moving out, but they should take responsibility for their actions (9). The OP is not being ungrateful or entitled for wanting to move out of their grandmother's house (5)."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the poster is not considering the needs of the wheelchair-bound lady and her service dogs, and is instead prioritizing the intended use of the playground for children. This aligns with statement 3, which states that the poster is acting like a freeloader taking advantage of the grandmother's generosity and then screwing her over. Statement 9 also aligns with this, as the poster is creating a problem for the wheelchair-bound lady by not accommodating her needs. Statement 5 aligns with my comment as well, as the poster is being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating the kindness and generosity of the wheelchair-bound lady. Statement 2 aligns with my comment as well, as the poster is not showing any courtesy to the wheelchair-bound lady. Statement 1 and 4 are similar and align with my comment as the poster should give notice to the wheelchair-bound lady. Statement 6 aligns with this as well, as the poster should let the wheelchair-bound lady know as soon as possible. Statement 10 aligns with my comment as the poster should be honest with the wheelchair-bound lady, but doesn't have to give details about their new place. Statement 7 and 8 are the least aligned with my comment, as the poster is not obligated to tell the wheelchair-bound lady about their personal life and 30 days notice is not necessary."

The lady was wrong for using a children's playground to entertain her dogs. Therefore, I strongly agree with statement 3, which calls out the person for being ungrateful and entitled.

Statement 2 and 1 are about showing courtesy and giving notice, which I agree with, but not as strongly as the previous statements. Statement 4 and 6 are about giving notice, which I agree with, but they are less important than taking responsibility for one's actions. Statement 10 is about being honest, which I agree with, but it is less important than taking responsibility for one's actions. Statement 7 is about not being obligated to share personal details, which I agree with, but it is less important than taking responsibility for one's actions.

Statement 6 is ranked higher than 1 and 4 because it emphasizes the need to let the grandmother know as soon as possible, which is important given the short timeline. Statement 10 is ranked lower because it suggests being honest but not giving details, which is not enough in this situation.

Statement 7 is ranked low because it implies that the person is not obligated to share personal information, but they still need to communicate their decision to move out.

As a parent with young children under three, I would have seen the dogs and went to a different park. I love dogs (most of the time). But I always err on the side of caution when it comes to dogs I don’t know. I am also disabled and have spent a lot of time with service dogs. Most, if not ALL, service dog handlers take their dogs to dog parks to help them get out energy and play. Not parks where children play.

It just seems like such a dumb risk. What if a child was allergic to dogs? What if a child decided to “play” with the dogs and the dogs got hurt? What if the dogs knocked a child off the play equipment? There’s just so many unknowns when it comes to strange dogs and strange children.

However, I disagree with the comments suggesting that the person should give their grandmother more notice than 30 days (8), show courtesy by letting her know they're moving out (2), or give details about their new place (10). I think the person should be honest with their grandmother and let her know they're moving out (10), but they don't have to give her details about their new place (7).

Being 'service dogs' is irrelevant in terms of the behaviour you describe.

Also:

Nope - dogs kill people by mauling them... even if the dogs have always been well-behaved and the victim is someone 'comfortable around dogs' e.g. recently in the UK a professional dog-walker was mauled to death by the dogs they were walking and a child was mauled to death by the family dog she 'had a loving relationship with'...",79,0,,,NTA,,NTA Being 'service dogs' is irrelevant in terms of the behaviour you describe.

Statement 9 is similar, as it suggests that the OP is creating a problem and should take responsibility for their actions. Statements 2, 4, and 6 are less critical of the OP, as they focus on the issue of notice rather than the request itself.

But if the dogs were, per their owner, “off duty”, then *there’s no possible service a leash could prevent them from performing.*

This has nothing to do with whether they were service dogs, b/c they weren't service dogs ""working"". They were service dogs ""on a break"" (or they weren't service dogs, whatever).  Whatever they were doing, these are strange dogs in an area designed for young children.

Go to a dog park.  I even understand running in a field, if otherwise empty.  But they shouldn't be on a busy playground.  Service dogs shouldn't even be accessible to others, especially children who have no self-control.

I also think people have audacity telling others what they should and should not be afraid of.  You don't know those dogs. You have a small child.

Service dogs shouldn't even be accessible to others, especially children who have no self-control. I also think people have audacity telling others what they should and should not be afraid of. You don't know those dogs. You have a small child. You are right to have a concern over your child's safety, and that trumps a dog's right to have fun (especially in a place for children!!! If your kid was running around in a dog park, I'd tell you to leave).","ORDER = [3, 9, 2, 6, 1, 4, 5, 10, 8, 7]

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly agree with statement 3, as the post describes the person as taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity and then ""screwing her over"" by not giving notice. I also agree with statement 9, as not giving notice creates a problem for the grandmother and the person should take responsibility for their actions. Statement 2 is similar to 6, but I ranked 2 higher because it acknowledges the person's lack of courtesy. Statement 1 and 4 are about giving notice, which I agree with, but not as strongly as the previous statements. Statement 5 implies the person is ungrateful and entitled, which I don't necessarily agree with based on the information provided. Statements 7 and 8 are about being honest and giving notice, which I agree with, but not as strongly as the previous statements. Statement 10 is the least important as it only mentions being honest about the new place, which is not the main issue here."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the person is not handling the situation with the wheelchair-bound lady and her service dogs appropriately. The person is creating an issue when there wasn't one, and the dogs were well-behaved and using the park as intended. Therefore, I strongly disagree with statement 7, which suggests that the person is not obligated to share personal information with their grandmother. However, I do agree that the person should be honest and let their grandmother know they are moving out (statement 10).

Furthermore, I agree with statements 1, 4, and 6, which suggest that the person should give their grandmother notice before moving out. However, I believe that 30 days' notice (statement 8) might not be enough time for the grandmother to make other arrangements, so I ranked statement 1 higher, which suggests giving the grandmother more time to find another tenant or make other arrangements.

I also agree with statements 2 and 5, which suggest that the person should show some courtesy and appreciation towards their grandmother. However, I ranked statement 3 higher because the person's behavior towards their grandmother seems to go beyond simple ingratitude and extends to taking advantage of her generosity.

Finally, I ranked statement 9 higher because the person's actions are creating a problem for their grandmother, and they should take responsibility for their actions. Overall, the person's behavior towards their grandmother and the wheelchair-bound lady with her service dogs shows a lack of consideration and empathy, and they should strive to do better."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the poster is not being malicious or disrespectful by wanting to move out of their grandmother's house. However, I do agree that the poster should let their grandmother know about their plans and take responsibility for their actions. Therefore, I agree with statements 3, 9, and 5, which all emphasize the importance of taking responsibility and being honest with the grandmother.

I also agree with statements 1, 4, and 6, which suggest that the poster should give their grandmother notice and treat her like any other landlord. However, I rank these statements lower because they seem less urgent and less important than the statements that emphasize responsibility and honesty.

Statement 2, which suggests that the poster has been living rent-free for 7 years, is not relevant to the issue at hand and seems to be more of a personal attack. Therefore, I rank it last.

Statement 7, which suggests that the poster is not obligated to share details about their personal life, is not in conflict with my stance. However, I rank it lower because it seems less relevant to the issue of giving notice and taking responsibility.

Statement 8, which suggests giving 30 days' notice, is not unreasonable, but it seems less important than the other statements that emphasize responsibility and notice. Therefore, I rank it second to last.

Statement 10, which suggests being honest but not sharing details, is not in conflict with my stance. However, I rank it lower because it seems less relevant to the issue of taking responsibility and giving notice."

Statement 2, which states that the person has been living with their grandmother virtually rent-free for 7 years, is a valid point and I agree with it. Statement 1, which states that the person should give their grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements, is a reasonable request and I agree with it. Statement 4, which states that the person should treat their grandmother like any other landlord and give her the same notice, is in line with my view that the person should have shown some courtesy and let their grandmother know they are moving out.

Therefore, statements 3 and 9, which express this sentiment, are ranked the highest. Statement 2 is ranked next as it acknowledges the poster's lack of courtesy towards their grandmother. Statement 5 is ranked next as it relates to the poster's entitlement and lack of appreciation for their grandmother's generosity. Statement 1 is ranked next as it suggests giving notice, which the poster has failed to do.

Statement 6 is ranked next as it stresses the importance of letting the grandmother know as soon as possible. Statement 10 is ranked next as it highlights the importance of being honest without giving unnecessary details.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly agree that the person is taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity and not showing any courtesy by not giving her notice (3, 9, 2, 6). I also believe that they should treat their grandmother like any other landlord and give her proper notice (4, 1). The person should take responsibility for creating a problem for their grandmother (9) and be honest about moving out (10, 5).

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the poster is not being considerate of the potential health risks that the service dogs could pose to children at the playground. This aligns with statement 3, which states that the poster is acting like a freeloader and taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity, as they are not considering the potential harm they could cause to others. Statement 9 also aligns with this, as the poster is creating a problem for others by not taking responsibility for their actions. Statement 5 aligns with my view that the poster is being entitled and ungrateful, as they are not considering the needs of the service dog owner or the children at the playground. Statement 1 and 2 align with the idea that the poster should have given notice to the service dog owner, as it would have allowed them to make other arrangements. Statement 4, 6, and 8 all relate to the idea of giving notice, but I believe that the health risks posed by the service dogs is a more pressing concern, so these statements are ranked lower. Statement 10 and 7 are ranked last as they are not relevant to the main issue at hand, which is the potential health risks posed by the service dogs."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe the original poster (OP) is not the asshole (NTA) for addressing the issue of the service dogs at the playground. Therefore, I strongly agree with statement 3, which states that the OP is not obligated to tolerate the service dogs if they are causing issues at the playground. I also agree with statement 5, which mentions that the OP is being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating the kindness and generosity of their grandmother. This is because the OP's actions of not informing their grandmother about their moving out plan can be seen as ungrateful.

Furthermore, I agree with statement 9, which states that the OP is creating a problem for their grandmother by not giving her notice and should take responsibility for their actions. This is because the OP should have informed their grandmother about their decision to move out, regardless of whether they want to share details about their new place or not.

I also agree with statement 1, which suggests that the OP should give their grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements for her house. This is because the OP's decision to move out will affect their grandmother's living arrangements, and the OP should give her enough time to make alternative plans.

Statement 4, which suggests that the OP should treat their grandmother like any other landlord and give her the same notice they would give to a stranger, is partially agreeable. While the OP should give their grandmother notice, they do not necessarily have to treat her like a stranger. However, I still agree with this statement because it emphasizes the importance of giving notice.

Statement 2, which states that the OP has been living with their grandmother virtually rent-free for 7 years and should show some courtesy and let her know they're moving out, is also partially agreeable. While the OP should show courtesy, they are not obligated to inform their grandmother of their personal life. However, I still agree with this statement because it highlights the importance of informing the grandmother of the OP's decision to move out.

Statement 6, which suggests that the OP should let their grandmother know they're moving out as soon as possible, is partially agreeable. While the OP should inform their grandmother as soon as possible, they do not necessarily have to do it immediately. However, I still agree with this statement because it emphasizes the importance of giving timely notice.

Statement 10, which states that the OP should be honest with their grandmother and let her know they're moving out but do not have to give her details about their new place, is partially agreeable. While the OP should be honest with their grandmother, they are not obligated to share details about their new place. However, I still agree with this statement because it highlights the importance of being honest with the grandmother.

Statement 7, which states that the OP is not obligated to tell their grandmother about their personal life but should let her know they're not going to rent her house, is partially agreeable. While the OP is not obligated to share personal details, they should still inform their grandmother of their decision to move out. However, I still agree with this statement because it emphasizes the importance of informing the grandmother of the OP's decision to move out.

Finally, statement 8, which suggests that the OP should give their grandmother 30 days' notice before moving out as a standard courtesy, is partially agreeable. While giving notice is important, the length of notice may vary depending on the circumstances. However, I still agree with this statement because it highlights the importance of giving notice."

Statement 3 aligns with my view that the person should have been more considerate of the wheelchair-bound lady's needs, and that they were being selfish and taking advantage of the situation. Statement 9 reinforces the idea that the person created a problem for the wheelchair-bound lady and should take responsibility for their actions. Statement 5 agrees with my comment that the person is being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating the wheelchair-bound lady's kindness and generosity in allowing the dogs in the playground. Statement 2 and 1 both suggest that the person should have given the wheelchair-bound lady notice, which I agree with, but they are not as strongly worded as statement 9, so I rank them lower.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the poster has a responsibility to inform the wheelchair-bound lady about her service dogs, especially if the dogs are not behaving properly. This aligns with statement 3, which mentions that the poster is creating a problem for the lady by not giving her notice and should take responsibility for her actions. Statement 5 also aligns with this view, as it mentions that the poster is being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating the kindness and generosity of the wheelchair-bound lady. Statement 9 also aligns with this view, as it mentions that the poster is creating a problem for the lady by not giving her notice.

Statement 2, ""You've been living with her virtually rent-free for 7 years, so you should show some courtesy and let her know you're moving out,"" is less liked because it implies that the poster's only responsibility is to inform the lady, rather than taking responsibility for the problem they are creating. Statement 1, ""You should give your grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements for her house,"" is less liked because it implies that the poster's responsibility is to help the lady find a new tenant, rather than addressing the problem of the service dogs.

Statement 4, ""You should treat your grandmother like any other landlord and give her the same notice you would give to a stranger,"" is less liked because it implies that the poster's relationship with the lady is purely transactional, rather than recognizing the special bond between them. Statement 6, ""You should let your grandmother know you're moving out as soon as possible so she can make other plans for her house,"" is less liked because it prioritizes the lady's need to make other plans over addressing the problem of the service dogs.

Statement 10, ""You should be honest with your grandmother and let her know you're moving out, but you don't have to give her details about your new place,"" is less liked because it implies that the poster's only responsibility is to inform the lady, rather than taking responsibility for the problem they are creating. Statement 7, ""You're not obligated to tell your grandmother about your personal life, but you should let her know you're not going to rent her house,"" is less liked because it implies that the poster's responsibility is to inform the lady, rather than addressing the problem of the service dogs.

Statement 8, ""You should give your grandmother 30 days' notice before moving out as a standard courtesy,"" is the least liked because it implies that the poster's only responsibility is to give notice, rather than taking responsibility for the problem they are creating. It also implies that 30 days is a sufficient amount of time for the lady to make other plans, which may not be the case."

At the party we typically have a huge costume contest. You pay 5 dollars to enter and if you win, you win the pot. We usually pull about 30 to 50 entries. So the prize is pretty nice. This year we had 40 people enter and about 160 people attending. 

In years past, the winner has been this one specific chick That my brothers wanna fuck. Her costume is usually the typical sorority girl costume (an animal of some kind, boots, fishnet leggings, a short skirt, basically a bra or corset, and then animal ears and light face paint). 

Now I’m not a Halloween nazi. This year my costume was literally just a angel wings, and white shorts, and a halo. I know fully that I’m dressing up so hot guys that think I’m hot will take notice and that it’s not a “good costume”. Her costume isn’t good. Sure, she looks good in it. But the point of the party is who has the best breasts

So we have the contest, and she’s wearing her MO. She was a bee, but her ass was hanging out and her boobs were about to fall out of her shirt. So we held the contest, people voted anonymously, and guess what. She won. But by one vote. I hadn’t voted yet, so I simply casted my vote then my vice chairman, who agreed with me casted his vote. That just happened to be enough to put her at second place. 

When I told my by brothers they bitched and moaned about it, but I told them she simply didn’t win and she should do better next year. They eventually talked me into creating a runner up prize of 50 dollars to the girl.

When we announced the winner, she was visibly upset. This was the first time she hasn’t won in the last 4 years. Now apparently, last night one of my brothers was simping hard and told her that I intentionally voted against her because I didn’t like her (not true, I’m genuinely apathetic about her).

She found me later that night and cursed me out and said I had a problem with her. I told her simply that we weren’t having a sluttiest costume contest, but a best costume contest and that she’s lucky we bent the rules to give her 50 bucks. We argued and ended up getting separated.

They eventually talked me into creating a runner up prize of 50 dollars to the girl. When we announced the winner, she was visibly upset. This was the first time she hasn’t won in the last 4 years. Now apparently, last night one of my brothers was simping hard and told her that I intentionally voted against her because I didn’t like her (not true, I’m genuinely apathetic about her). She found me later that night and cursed me out and said I had a problem with her. I told her simply that we weren’t having a sluttiest costume contest, but a best costume contest and that she’s lucky we bent the rules to give her 50 bucks. We argued and ended up getting separated. Now a lot of my brothers are pissed at me for pissing her off.",

REASONING = Based on my comment, I don't think the poster is an asshole for making a woman lose a costume contest. However, I do think the poster is acting inconsiderately towards their grandmother by not giving her notice about moving out. I agree with statements 3 and 9 the most, as they strongly convey the idea of taking responsibility for one's actions and the impact it has on others. Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 also resonate with me, as they suggest giving notice and being respectful towards the grandmother. Statements 6, 10, 7, and 8 are less important to me, as they either repeat the same idea or suggest giving less notice than what I think is appropriate."

This aligns with statement 3, which mentions taking advantage of someone's generosity and then screwing them over. Statement 9 also aligns with this, as the poster is creating a problem for their grandmother by not giving notice. Statement 1 and 6 are about giving notice, which the poster should have done, but it's less important than the special treatment they gave. Statement 4 and 2 are about showing courtesy, which the poster did not do, but it's less important than taking advantage of someone's generosity.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the original poster (OP) shares some of the blame for the situation, so I think that statements implying that the OP is solely at fault or ungrateful (3, 9, 5) should be ranked higher. Statement 3 is the most strongly worded and directly implies that the OP is taking advantage of their grandmother, so it is ranked first. Statement 9 is similar but less strongly worded, so it is ranked second. Statement 5 is less directly related to the situation but still implies that the OP is ungrateful, so it is ranked third.

Statements implying that the OP should have given their grandmother notice (1, 2, 4, 6) should be ranked next, with the more strongly worded statements ranked higher. Statement 1 is ranked fourth because it implies that the OP should have given notice out of courtesy, but does not directly blame the OP for not doing so. Statement 2 is ranked fifth because it implies that the OP should have given notice as a matter of basic courtesy, given that they have been living with their grandmother rent-free for 7 years. Statement 4 is ranked sixth because it implies that the OP should have treated their grandmother like any other landlord, but does not directly blame the OP for not doing so. Statement 6 is ranked seventh because it is similar to statement 2 but less strongly worded.

Statements implying that the OP is not obligated to give details about their personal life (7, 10) should be ranked next. Statement 7 is ranked eighth because it implies that the OP is not obligated to share details about their personal life, but should still let their grandmother know that they are moving out. Statement 10 is ranked ninth because it is similar to statement 7 but less strongly worded.

Statement 8, which implies that the OP should give their grandmother 30 days' notice as a standard courtesy, should be ranked last because it is the least relevant to my comment and the situation described in the original post."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe the poster is not the asshole in this situation, and the focus should be on the grandmother's house and the notice period. I agree with statements 3 and 9, which criticize the poster for taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity. Statement 2 is less harsh and acknowledges that the poster has been living there rent-free for a long time. Statement 1 is a more moderate version of statement 3, and I agree with it to some extent. Statement 6 is similar to statement 1, but I rank it lower because it suggests a shorter notice period. Statement 4 is a more formal version of statement 1, and I agree with it less because it ignores the special relationship between the poster and their grandmother. Statement 5 is a moral judgment and less relevant to the situation, so I rank it lower. Statement 8 is a specific version of statement 9, and I agree with it less because it suggests a fixed notice period. Statement 10 is a compromise between being honest and not giving details, and I agree with it less because it does not address the grandmother's needs. Statement 7 is the least relevant statement because it focuses on the poster's personal life, and I rank it last."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the poster is not treating their grandmother with the respect and gratitude she deserves. Therefore, statements that highlight the poster's lack of responsibility and entitlement are ranked higher. Statement 3 is ranked first because it directly calls out the poster's behavior as taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity. Statement 9 is ranked second because it emphasizes the responsibility the poster has to take for creating a problem for their grandmother. Statements 1 and 2 are ranked next because they both suggest that the poster should give their grandmother notice, which is a basic courtesy and responsibility. Statement 4 is ranked next because it reinforces the idea that the poster should treat their grandmother like any other landlord, which they are not currently doing. Statement 5 is ranked next because it highlights the poster's ungrateful and entitled behavior. Statements 6 and 10 are ranked next because they suggest that the poster should let their grandmother know they are moving out, but do not necessarily require the poster to be fully honest about their new living arrangements. Statement 7 is ranked next because it acknowledges that the poster is not obligated to share personal details, but still emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility for their actions. Statement 8 is ranked last because it suggests a specific time frame for giving notice, which is less important than the overall lack of respect and gratitude the poster has shown towards their grandmother."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the poster is TA (the asshole) for lying about not caring for the woman and then writing a whole post about it. This shows a clear lack of honesty and respect for the woman. Therefore, I agree with statement 3, which states that the poster is acting like a freeloader who is taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity and then screwing her over.

I also agree with statement 9, which states that the poster is creating a problem for their grandmother by not giving her notice and should take responsibility for their actions. This is because the poster's lack of notice is causing inconvenience and stress for their grandmother, and they should be considerate of that.

Statement 1, which suggests giving the grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements for her house, is also reasonable. However, I rank it lower than statement 9 because it is less directly related to the poster's lack of honesty and respect.

Statement 2, which states that the poster should show some courtesy and let the grandmother know they are moving out, is also reasonable. However, I rank it lower than statement 1 because it is less urgent and specific.

Statement 5, which states that the poster is being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating their grandmother's kindness and generosity over the years, is partially true. However, I rank it lower than statements 1 and 2 because it is less directly related to the poster's lack of notice and honesty.

Statement 4, which states that the poster should treat their grandmother like any other landlord and give her the same notice they would give to a stranger, is reasonable. However, I rank it lower than statement 5 because it is less urgent and specific.

Statement 6, which states that the poster should let their grandmother know they are moving out as soon as possible so she can make other plans for her house, is reasonable. However, I rank it lower than statement 4 because it is less direct and specific.

Statement 8, which states that the poster should give their grandmother 30 days' notice before moving out as a standard courtesy, is reasonable. However, I rank it lower than statement 6 because it is less urgent and specific.

Statement 10, which states that the poster should be honest with their grandmother and let her know they are moving out, but don't have to give her details about their new place, is partially true. However, I rank it lower than statement 8 because it is less urgent and specific.

Statement 7, which states that the poster is not obligated to tell their grandmother about their personal life, but should let her know they are not going to rent her house, is partially true. However, I rank it last because it is the least urgent and specific statement in the slate."

However, the way the person is handling the situation with their grandmother is not fair.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the original poster (OP) is not an asshole for making a woman lose a costume contest. Instead, I am more concerned about the OP's relationship with their grandmother. The OP has been living with their grandmother for 7 years rent-free, and I believe they should show some basic courtesy and let her know they are moving out. Therefore, I agree with statements 3, 9, 2, 6, and 1, which all emphasize the importance of giving the grandmother notice and being respectful.

I also agree with statements 4 and 5, which suggest that the OP should treat their grandmother like any other landlord and be grateful for her kindness and generosity. However, I rank these statements lower because they seem less urgent than the previous statements.

Statement 10 suggests that the OP should be honest with their grandmother but doesn't need to give her details about their new place. I agree with this statement, but I rank it lower because it seems less important than the other statements.

Statement 8 suggests that the OP should give their grandmother 30 days' notice before moving out. While I agree that this is a standard courtesy, I rank it lower because it is less urgent than the other statements.

Finally, I disagree with statements 7 and 1, which suggest that the OP is not obligated to tell their grandmother about their personal life or that they should treat their grandmother like any other landlord. I believe that the OP should show some basic respect and courtesy to their grandmother, and therefore, I rank these statements last."

REASONING: Based on the comment, the key issue at hand is whether the grandmother was wronged by not being given notice before the tenant moves out. The most agreed-upon statement is that the tenant is acting like a freeloader and screwing over the grandmother (statement 3). This is followed by the idea that the tenant is creating a problem for the grandmother and should take responsibility for their actions (statement 9). The next few statements (1, 2, 4) all relate to the idea that the tenant should give notice to the grandmother, with varying levels of emphasis on the fact that the grandmother is not just any landlord, but a family member. Statements 5 and 7, while not directly addressing the issue of notice, imply that the tenant is being ungrateful and entitled, and that they are not obligated to share personal details with the grandmother. Statements 6 and 8 are similar to statements 1 and 2, but with a specific time frame of 30 days' notice, and are ranked lower because the exact time frame is less important than the overall idea of giving notice. Statement 10, which suggests that the tenant should be honest but doesn't require them to give details about their new place, is ranked last because it is the least relevant to the issue of giving notice."

Statement 9 also highlights the responsibility of taking action and informing the grandmother, which I agree with. Statements 1 and 6 emphasize giving notice, which I agree with but rank lower since they don't address the entitlement issue. Statements 4 and 2 are similar, but I rank 2 lower because it downplays the importance of giving notice. Statements 5 and 7 are about being ungrateful and not sharing personal details, but they don't directly address the main issue, so I rank them lower. Statement 10 is about being honest but not sharing details, which I rank lower since it doesn't address the need for notice or the poster's behavior. Statement 8, suggesting 30 days' notice, is ranked last because it's less strict than statement 6's ""as soon as possible"" notice."

Giving notice and being honest about moving out is important (statements 1, 6, 2, 5), and I agree that the person should treat their grandmother like any other landlord (statement 4).

REASONING: The comment states that the AITA is the person who made the woman lose the contest by voting after all votes had been cast. This implies that the person acted unfairly and irresponsibly, which aligns with statement 3, ""You're acting like a freeloader who's taking advantage of your grandmother's generosity and then screwing her over."" The person is not giving their grandmother the notice she deserves, which is unfair and irresponsible.

The following statements (9, 1, 2, 5) all relate to the person's responsibility to give their grandmother notice before moving out. Statement 9, ""You're creating a problem for your grandmother by not giving her notice, and you should take responsibility for your actions,"" aligns the most with the comment, as it highlights the person's responsibility and irresponsibility. Statement 1, ""You should give your grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements for her house,"" and statement 2, ""You've been living with her virtually rent-free for 7 years, so you should show some courtesy and let her know you're moving out,"" both suggest that the person should give their grandmother notice, which is a responsible action. Statement 5, ""You're being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating your grandmother's kindness and generosity over the years,"" implies that the person is taking advantage of their grandmother's kindness, which is a negative action.

Statement 4, ""You should treat your grandmother like any other landlord and give her the same notice you would give to a stranger,"" is similar to statement 1, but it emphasizes treating the grandmother like a stranger, which is not a positive action. Statement 6, ""You should let your grandmother know you're moving out as soon as possible so she can make other plans for her house,"" is a responsible action, but it is less urgent than giving notice. Statement 10, ""You should be honest with your grandmother and let her know you're moving out, but you don't have to give her details about your new place,"" emphasizes honesty, which is a positive action, but it does not address the responsibility of giving notice. Statement 8, ""You should give your grandmother 30 days' notice before moving out as a standard courtesy,"" is a responsible action, but it is less urgent than giving notice. Statement 7, ""You're not obligated to tell your grandmother about your personal life, but you should let her know you're not going to rent her house,"" emphasizes the person's right to privacy, but it does not address the responsibility of giving notice."

I also agree with statement 5, which calls the OP ungrateful for not appreciating their grandmother's generosity.

I agree with statements 1 and 2, which suggest that the OP should give their grandmother notice before moving out, but I rank them lower because they do not address the OP's lack of gratitude. I rank statement 4 lower because it suggests treating the grandmother like any other landlord, which does not take into account the personal relationship between the two.

I rank statement 6 higher than 1 and 2 because it emphasizes the urgency of the situation and the need for the OP to take responsibility for their actions. I rank statement 8 lower because it suggests a specific time frame for giving notice, which may not be necessary in this situation.

I rank statement 7 lower because it suggests that the OP is not obligated to share personal details with their grandmother, which is not the main issue at hand. I rank statement 10 last because it suggests being honest with the grandmother, but does not address the lack of consideration and gratitude shown by the OP."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly believe that the person is taking advantage of their grandmother's kindness and being inconsiderate by not giving her notice before moving out. Therefore, I agree with statements 3 and 9, which express this sentiment. I also agree with statement 1, which suggests giving notice so that the grandmother can find another tenant or make other arrangements. Statement 6, which suggests letting the grandmother know as soon as possible, is also reasonable. Statement 4, which suggests treating the grandmother like any other landlord, is in line with my perspective. I do not agree with statement 2, which implies that the person has no obligation to be courteous because they have been living there rent-free for 7 years. I also disagree with statement 5, which suggests that the person is ungrateful and entitled, as I don't have enough information about their relationship with their grandmother to make that judgment. Statements 10, 8, and 7 are less important in this context, but I still rank them in order of how much they align with my perspective."

Statement 3 is ranked first because it most directly calls out the OP's behavior as taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity. Statement 9 is ranked second because it emphasizes the OP's responsibility to take care of the situation they created for their grandmother.

Statements 4 and 5 are ranked next because they imply the OP has been ungrateful and entitled, which is mentioned in my comment as a potential reason for the OP's behavior. Statements 6 and 10 are ranked next because they suggest the OP should be honest with their grandmother, which is a less direct criticism of the OP's behavior. Statement 7 is ranked next because it acknowledges the OP's right to privacy, but still places some responsibility on the OP to communicate their plans.

Statement 2, while acknowledging the need to give notice, does not address the power dynamic between the poster and their grandmother, so I rank it lower. Statements 6 and 8, which suggest giving notice, are ranked lower because they don't address the underlying issue of the poster's behavior. Statement 7, which suggests that the poster doesn't need to share personal details, is ranked last because it does not address the need for basic courtesy and respect towards the grandmother.

However, I also agree that the poster should take responsibility for their actions and not leave their grandmother in a difficult situation. I agree with statement 3 the most because it strongly conveys the idea that the poster is taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity.

These statements highlight the OP's lack of consideration and responsibility towards their grandmother. Statement 3 is the most direct and strongest statement, so it is ranked first. Statements 1, 4, 6, and 9 all emphasize the importance of giving notice and taking responsibility for one's actions, which the OP failed to do.

Statement 2 acknowledges that the OP is not obligated to give details about their new place, but still emphasizes the importance of being honest and taking responsibility. Statement 5 implies that the OP is ungrateful and entitled, which is a less direct way of saying they are in the wrong. Statement 7 acknowledges that the OP is not obligated to share personal details, but still implies that they should take responsibility for their actions.

Statements 8 and 10 are the least critical of the OP, as they suggest that the OP should give notice, but do not explicitly criticize them for not doing so. These statements are ranked last because they are the least reflective of my stance that the OP is the asshole."

REASONING: Based on the comment, the poster is considered the asshole for not giving their grandmother notice before moving out and adding their vote to make the woman lose the contest. The strongest statements against the poster's actions are those that highlight their lack of courtesy and gratitude towards their grandmother, as well as their selfish behavior. These statements include ""You're acting like a freeloader who's taking advantage of your grandmother's generosity and then screwing her over"" (3), ""You're creating a problem for your grandmother by not giving her notice, and you should take responsibility for your actions"" (9), and ""You should give your grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements for her house"" (1).

The next set of statements that the poster agrees with to a certain extent are those that emphasize the importance of giving notice and being honest with the grandmother. These statements include ""You should let your grandmother know you're moving out as soon as possible so she can make other plans for her house"" (6), ""You should treat your grandmother like any other landlord and give her the same notice you would give to a stranger"" (4), and ""You should be honest with your grandmother and let her know you're moving out, but you don't have to give her details about your new place"" (10).

The remaining statements that the poster disagrees with are those that suggest the poster should give more notice than necessary or provide details about their personal life. These statements include ""You've been living with her virtually rent-free for 7 years, so you should show some courtesy and let her know you're moving out"" (2), ""You're being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating your grandmother's kindness and generosity over the years"" (5), ""You should give your grandmother 30 days' notice before moving out as a standard courtesy"" (8), and ""You're not obligated to tell your grandmother about your personal life, but you should let her know you're not going to rent her house"" (7). These statements are ranked lower because they are less relevant to the main issue of not giving notice and being dishonest."

Statement 9 also resonates with the comment, as it involves creating a problem for someone else and taking responsibility for one's actions.

Statement 4 is also in line with this, as it emphasizes the need to treat the grandmother like any other landlord. Statement 5 is in agreement with my comment that the OP is being ungrateful and entitled. Statement 2 is the least liked because it downplays the significance of the OP's actions and implies that there is no point in blaming people now. Statement 6 is similar to statement 1, but lower in the ranking because it suggests that the OP should let the grandmother know as soon as possible, but does not specify a time frame.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the poster is in the wrong for cheating and not being honest with the woman about the voting results. Looking at the slate, I agree with statement 3 the most because the poster is indeed taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity and then screwing her over by not giving her notice. Statement 9 is also closely related to this as the poster is creating a problem for their grandmother by not giving her notice and should take responsibility for their actions.

Statement 1 and 2 are similar, but I put 1 before 2 because the poster should give their grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements for her house. Statement 4 is also similar to 1 and 2, but I put it after because it emphasizes treating the grandmother like any other landlord, which is still not as important as taking responsibility for the actions.

Statements 5 and 6 are about being ungrateful and entitled, which is not as bad as taking advantage of someone's generosity, but still not good. Statement 7 is about not being obligated to tell the grandmother about personal life, but I put it after 5 and 6 because it's still important to let her know about the moving out plans.

Statement 10 is about being honest, but it's less important than taking responsibility for the actions, so I put it after 7. Statement 8 is about giving 30 days' notice, which is a standard courtesy, but not as important as taking responsibility for the actions, so I put it last."

REASONING: Based on the comment, the poster is the asshole for not knowing the correct term to use. This shows a lack of respect and disregard for the English language and the costume contest. Therefore, statements that highlight the poster's lack of consideration for others, such as ""You're acting like a freeloader who's taking advantage of your grandmother's generosity and then screwing her over"" and ""You're creating a problem for your grandmother by not giving her notice, and you should take responsibility for your actions"" are ranked higher.

The statement ""You should let your grandmother know you're moving out as soon as possible so she can make other plans for her house"" is ranked next because it is a reasonable request and shows some consideration for the grandmother.

The statement ""You should give your grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements for her house"" is ranked higher than ""You should treat your grandmother like any other landlord and give her the same notice you would give to a stranger"" because it shows a greater level of concern for the grandmother's well-being.

The statement ""You're being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating your grandmother's kindness and generosity over the years"" is ranked lower because it is a subjective judgment and does not directly address the issue at hand.

The statement ""You should give your grandmother 30 days' notice before moving out as a standard courtesy"" is ranked higher than ""You should be honest with your grandmother and let her know you're moving out, but you don't have to give her details about your new place"" because it shows a greater level of respect and consideration for the grandmother.

The statement ""You should let your grandmother know you're moving out as soon as possible so she can make other plans for her house"" is ranked higher than ""You should give your grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements for her house"" because it is a more urgent request and shows a greater level of concern for the grandmother's immediate needs.

The statement ""You should treat your grandmother like any other landlord and give her the same notice you would give to a stranger"" is ranked higher than ""You're not obligated to tell your grandmother about your personal life, but you should let her know you're not going to rent her house"" because it shows a greater level of respect and consideration for the grandmother as a landlord.

The statement ""You should give your grandmother 30 days' notice before moving out as a standard courtesy"" is ranked higher than ""You should be honest with your grandmother and let her know you're moving out, but you don't have to give her details about your new place"" because it shows a greater level of respect and consideration for the grandmother.

The statement ""You should be honest with your grandmother and let her know you're moving out, but you don't have to give her details about your new place"" is ranked last because it is the least direct and considerate of the statements towards the grandmother."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe the poster is not showing enough respect to the woman they made lose the contest. This aligns with statement 3, which mentions the poster acting like a freeloader taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity. I also agree with statement 9, which states the poster is creating a problem for their grandmother by not giving her notice and should take responsibility for their actions.

I agree with statements 1 and 2, which suggest the poster should let their grandmother know they are moving out and give her notice. However, these statements are less important than the aforementioned ones because they do not address the disrespectful behavior towards the woman in the contest.

Statements 4, 6, and 5 are also in line with the idea of giving notice, but they are less important than statements 1 and 2 because they do not emphasize the importance of showing courtesy and respect.

Statement 10 suggests being honest with the grandmother, but it is less important than the other statements because it does not address the main issue of disrespect.

Statement 7 focuses on the poster's personal life and is the least relevant to the situation.

Statement 8 suggests giving 30 days' notice, which is a standard courtesy, but it is less important than the other statements because it does not address the disrespectful behavior or the importance of showing gratitude and respect."

I agree with statement 6, which suggests informing the grandmother as soon as possible, and statement 10, which suggests being honest but not sharing details.

I agree with statement 3 the most, as the OP has been living with their grandmother rent-free for 7 years and should show some courtesy by letting her know they are moving out. Statement 9 follows closely, as the OP is creating a problem for their grandmother by not giving her notice. I also agree with statement 5, as the OP seems ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating their grandmother's kindness over the years.

Statement 4 is similar to statement 1, but I agree with statement 2 more. Statement 6 is reasonable, but I believe statement 9 is more important. Statement 10 is the least important, as the OP is not obligated to give details about their new place, but they should be honest about moving out.

REASONING: Based on the comment, the original poster (OP) seems to be dismissive of the situation and its impact on their grandmother. This suggests that the OP is not showing enough respect or consideration for their grandmother's situation. Therefore, I agree with statements that criticize the OP for their lack of responsibility and gratitude.

Statement 3 is the most agreed upon statement as it directly calls out the OP for taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity. Statement 9 also highlights the OP's responsibility in creating a problem for their grandmother and should take responsibility for their actions.

Statement 1 and 6 are similar in nature, but I ranked statement 1 higher because it emphasizes the need for the OP to give their grandmother notice so she can make other arrangements. Statement 4 is also similar but less direct, so I ranked it lower.

Statement 2 and 5 are less relevant to the main issue of not giving notice and are more focused on the OP's attitude towards their grandmother's kindness. I ranked them lower because they do not directly address the main issue.

Statement 10 and 8 are ranked lower because they suggest that the OP is not obligated to give details about their new place or a specific notice period. While this may be true, it does not address the main issue of not giving notice and not taking responsibility for their actions.

Statement 7 is ranked last because it suggests that the OP is not obligated to share their personal life with their grandmother. While this may be true, it does not address the main issue of not giving notice and not taking responsibility for their actions."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the OP is TA for how they described the situation, indicating they have a negative attitude towards the woman who lost the contest. This aligns with statement 3, which accuses the OP of taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity and then screwing her over. Statement 9 also aligns with this, as it mentions creating a problem for the grandmother by not giving notice. Statement 5 is similar in that it accuses the OP of being ungrateful and entitled, which is in line with the negative attitude displayed in the comment. Statement 1 and 4 both mention giving notice, which is a responsible action, but it is less important than the aforementioned statements as it does not address the OP's negative attitude. Statement 2 and 6 both mention the length of time the OP has been living with their grandmother, but they do not address the main issue of the OP's negative attitude. Statement 10 and 8 both mention giving notice, but they are less important than the other statements as they do not address the main issue of the OP's negative attitude.

However, the grandmother is also at fault for not treating the person making the post like a tenant and expecting them to give notice. I agree with statements 3 and 9 the most because they highlight the person making the post's lack of consideration for their grandmother's situation. I also agree with statements 1, 6, and 4, which emphasize the importance of giving notice and making other arrangements. Statement 2 is less agreeable because it implies that the person making the post has no responsibility to their grandmother.

I put statement 6 before statement 1 because it's more specific and emphasizes the urgency of the situation.

Therefore, statements 3 and 9 are ranked high, as they reflect the person's irresponsibility and lack of consideration for the grandmother's situation. Statement 1 is ranked high because it suggests giving notice, which is a basic courtesy. Statement 6 is ranked high because it emphasizes the need to let the grandmother know as soon as possible. Statement 4 is ranked high because it suggests treating the grandmother like any other landlord, which is reasonable. Statement 2 is ranked low because it downplays the importance of giving notice. Statement 5 is ranked low because it implies that the person is ungrateful, which may not be the case if there is a language barrier. Statement 8 is ranked low because it suggests a specific time frame for giving notice, which may not be necessary.

REASONING: Based on the comment, it seems like the poster does not view their grandmother as a victim in this situation and believes that they are not obligated to share details about their new place. However, they do acknowledge that they should take responsibility for their actions and not create a problem for their grandmother. Therefore, I have ranked the statements that emphasize taking responsibility and not causing problems higher. The statement that the poster is acting like a freeloader is ranked first because it most closely aligns with the comment's suggestion that the grandmother may act irrationally and ""fuck with"" the poster. The statement that the poster should give their grandmother notice so she can make other arrangements is ranked second because it is the most direct and practical solution to avoiding creating a problem for the grandmother. The statement that the poster should treat their grandmother like any other landlord is ranked third because it emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility and not causing problems. The statement that the poster is being ungrateful and entitled is ranked fourth because it implies that the grandmother has been kind and generous, which aligns with the comment's suggestion that the grandmother may act irrationally if she finds out about the move after the fact. The statement that the poster should let their grandmother know they are moving out as soon as possible is ranked fifth because it emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility and avoiding creating problems. The statement that the poster should be honest with their grandmother is ranked sixth because it aligns with the comment's suggestion that the grandmother may act irrationally if she finds out about the move after the fact. The statement that the poster should give their grandmother 30 days' notice is ranked seventh because it is a specific and practical solution to avoiding creating problems. The statement that the poster should let their grandmother know they are not going to rent her house is ranked eighth because it emphasizes the importance of being honest and avoiding creating problems. The statement that the poster is not obligated to tell their grandmother about their personal life is ranked ninth because it aligns with the comment's suggestion that the grandmother may act irrationally if she finds out about the move after the fact. The statement that the poster should give their grandmother notice as a standard courtesy is ranked tenth because it is a general and less specific solution to avoiding creating problems."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that the poster is not taking into consideration the feelings and efforts of their grandmother, which is why I have ranked statements 3 and 5 highly. Statement 2 follows closely as it highlights the lack of courtesy shown by the poster. Statements 1 and 4 emphasize the need for notice, which I agree with, but I believe that the situation warrants more than just standard notice, hence their lower ranking. Statements 6 and 9 highlight the responsibility that the poster has towards their grandmother, which I agree with, and that is why they are ranked higher than statements 7 and 8, which suggest a more casual approach to the situation. Statement 10 is ranked last as it suggests that the poster should be honest with their grandmother, but it does not emphasize the importance of giving notice or taking responsibility for their actions."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the OP is TA (the asshole) for not telling their grandmother they bought a house. Looking at the slate, I agree with statements that highlight the OP's lack of consideration and gratitude towards their grandmother. Statement 3 is the strongest in expressing this view, so it's ranked first. Statement 9 emphasizes the problem the OP is creating for their grandmother, which I also strongly agree with, so it's ranked second.

Statements 1, 6, and 4 all convey the idea that the OP should give their grandmother notice, which I agree with, so they are ranked 3rd, 4th, and 5th, respectively. Statement 1 is ranked higher than 6 and 4 because it implies the OP should help their grandmother find another tenant or make other arrangements, showing more concern for their grandmother's situation.

Statements 2 and 5 are similar in expressing disappointment in the OP's lack of appreciation and entitlement, so they are ranked 6th and 7th, with 5 ranked lower because it focuses more on the OP's attitude rather than the specific issue at hand.

Statements 8 and 7 both suggest that the OP isn't obligated to share details about their personal life, but they should still inform their grandmother about the move. I agree with this, but since statement 7 implies a lesser degree of obligation, it's ranked lower (8th) than statement 8 (7th).

Finally, statement 10 is ranked last because it suggests the OP can be honest without sharing details, which I think is the least important point considering the overall situation."

She will be moving to another state and doesn't need a vacant house to worry about.","ORDER = [3, 9, 6, 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 10, 7]

REASONING: Based on my comment, it is clear that I believe OP needs to take responsibility for their actions and inform their grandmother about the new house as soon as possible. This is because their grandmother will be moving to another state and needs to make arrangements for her current house. Therefore, I agree with statements 3, 9, 6, 1, and 4, which all emphasize the importance of giving notice and taking responsibility.

Statement 3 is the strongest statement, as it implies that OP is taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity and then screwing her over. This is the most direct and critical statement, and I agree with it the most.

Statement 9 is also a strong statement, as it highlights the fact that OP is creating a problem for their grandmother by not giving notice. This statement aligns with my belief that OP needs to take responsibility for their actions.

Statement 6 is similar to statement 1, but I rank it higher because it emphasizes the importance of letting the grandmother know as soon as possible.

Statement 1 is also a strong statement, as it emphasizes the importance of giving notice so that the grandmother can make other arrangements for her house.

Statement 4 is also a strong statement, as it emphasizes the importance of treating the grandmother like any other landlord and giving her the same notice that would be given to a stranger.

Statement 2 is lower on my list because it focuses on the fact that OP has been living with their grandmother for free for 7 years, rather than the importance of giving notice.

Statement 8 is lower on my list because it only emphasizes the importance of giving 30 days' notice, rather than the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions.

Statement 5 is lower on my list because it focuses on the fact that OP is ungrateful and entitled, rather than the importance of giving notice.

Statement 10 is the lowest on my list because it implies that OP is not obligated to tell their grandmother about their personal life, which is not the main issue here. The main issue is the importance of giving notice and taking responsibility for one's actions."

I agree with statements 3 and 9, which express this sentiment. I also agree with statements 1, 2, 4, and 6, which emphasize the importance of giving notice and showing courtesy to the grandmother. Statements 5 and 10 are less strongly worded and seem to focus more on the poster's lack of gratitude, but I still agree with them.

Therefore, statements that highlight their freeloading behavior and entitlement are ranked higher. Statements that suggest giving notice or being honest with the grandmother are ranked lower, as they still show a lack of appreciation for the grandmother's generosity. Statements that suggest the poster should treat their grandmother like any other landlord are ranked in the middle, as they acknowledge the need for some level of courtesy but still do not fully recognize the unique relationship between the poster and their grandmother."

I also think that the grandmother should be given ample time to make other arrangements for her house (statement 9) and that the OP should take responsibility for creating this situation (statement 9). I agree that the OP has been living rent-free with the grandmother for a long time (statement 2) and that they should be honest and transparent about the move (statement 10). However, I disagree with statements 5 and 3, which suggest that the OP is ungrateful and taking advantage of the grandmother's kindness. I believe that the OP has the right to move out and start their own life (as stated in my comment) and that the focus should be on finding a solution that works for both parties.

I agree with statement 1 because it is a common courtesy to let a landlord know if you are moving out, and the grandmother is the OP's landlord.

REASONING = Based on my comment, I strongly believe that the OP is taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity and being inconsiderate by not telling her about buying a house. Therefore, statements 3 and 9, which express this sentiment, are ranked the highest. Statement 1 is ranked next because it is important to give notice to the grandmother so she can make other arrangements for her house. Statement 6 is ranked next because the OP has been living with her virtually rent-free for 7 years, so they should let her know they're moving out as soon as possible. Statement 4 is ranked next because the OP should treat their grandmother like any other landlord and give her the same notice they would give to a stranger. Statement 2 is ranked next because it is a common courtesy to let the grandmother know they're moving out. Statement 5 is ranked next because the OP is being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating their grandmother's kindness and generosity over the years. Statement 10 is ranked next because the OP is not obligated to tell their grandmother about their personal life, but they should let her know they're not going to rent her house. Statement 8 is ranked next because giving 30 days' notice is a standard courtesy. Statement 7 is ranked last because the OP is not obligated to give details about their new place."

Therefore, I agree with statements 3 and 5, which highlight the OP's lack of gratitude and entitlement. Statement 2 aligns with this perspective, as it emphasizes the importance of showing courtesy to the grandmother. Statement 9 is also in line with my comment, as it stresses the need for the OP to take responsibility for their actions and the consequences of not giving notice. Statement 1 highlights the need for notice, and statement 4 reinforces the idea of treating the grandmother like any other landlord. Statement 6 emphasizes the urgency of giving notice, and statement 10 suggests that the OP should be honest with their grandmother but doesn't have to give details about their new place. Statement 8 suggests a specific time frame for giving notice, and statement 7 implies that the OP is not obligated to share personal details with their grandmother, but should still inform her of their plans. Overall, I prioritize statements that emphasize the need for respect, consideration, and responsibility towards the grandmother, while also acknowledging the importance of giving notice and being honest."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the OP is in the wrong for not giving their grandmother notice that they are moving out. Therefore, statements that agree with this sentiment are ranked higher. Statement 3 is the strongest statement in agreement with my comment, as it implies that the OP is taking advantage of their grandmother's generosity. Statement 9 is also in agreement, emphasizing that the OP is creating a problem for their grandmother by not giving notice. Statement 1 and 6 are also in agreement, stating that the OP should give their grandmother notice so she can make other arrangements for her house.

Statements 2, 4, and 5 are ranked lower because while they suggest that the OP should give notice, they do not emphasize the impact of not giving notice on the grandmother. Statement 2 focuses on the length of time the OP has been living with their grandmother, but does not mention the grandmother's needs. Statement 4 compares the grandmother to a stranger, which is not entirely accurate as the grandmother is a family member. Statement 5 focuses on the OP's gratitude and entitlement, but does not directly address the issue of notice.

Statements 10, 8, and 7 are ranked the lowest because they suggest that the OP is not obligated to give details about their new place or that the OP is not obligated to tell their grandmother about their personal life.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the OP is in the wrong here. The most important thing is that they are not being honest with their grandmother and are creating a problem for her by not giving her notice. This is why statement 3, ""You're acting like a freeloader who's taking advantage of your grandmother's generosity and then screwing her over,"" is at the top of the list. Statement 9, ""You're creating a problem for your grandmother by not giving her notice, and you should take responsibility for your actions,"" is also near the top because it highlights the OP's responsibility in the situation.

I also think that the OP should give their grandmother notice so she can make other arrangements for her house, which is why statement 1, ""You should give your grandmother notice so she can find another tenant or make other arrangements for her house,"" is near the top of the list. Statement 6, ""You should let your grandmother know you're moving out as soon as possible so she can make other plans for her house,"" is also near the top for the same reason.

Furthermore, I think that the OP should show some basic courtesy and let their grandmother know they are moving out, which is why statement 2, ""You've been living with her virtually rent-free for 7 years, so you should show some courtesy and let her know you're moving out,"" is near the top of the list. Statement 4, ""You should treat your grandmother like any other landlord and give her the same notice you would give to a stranger,"" is also near the top for the same reason.

I also think that the OP is being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating their grandmother's kindness and generosity over the years, which is why statement 5, ""You're being ungrateful and entitled for not appreciating your grandmother's kindness and generosity over the years,"" is near the bottom of the list. Statement 7, ""You're not obligated to tell your grandmother about your personal life, but you should let her know you're not going to rent her house,"" is also near the bottom because it highlights the OP's lack of obligation to their grandmother.

Finally, I think that the OP should give their grandmother 30 days' notice before moving out as a standard courtesy, which is why statement 8, ""You should give your grandmother 30 days' notice before moving out as a standard courtesy,"" is near the bottom of the list. Statement 10, ""You should be honest with your grandmother and let her know you're moving out, but you don't have to give her details about your new place,"" is also near the bottom because it highlights the OP's obligation to be honest with their grandmother, but not to give her unnecessary details."

Post,1giwkq5,AITAH My girlfriend took my car without permission ,jesseny23,2024-11-03 20:36:16,"A year ago, my girlfriend and I met at work, but we've only been dating for 3 months. We became close after she experienced a traumatic event and I wanted to support her due to my own experience with abuse. We fell in love quickly despite our pasts. Although we both have trust issues, we're learning to communicate and work through our disagreements. However, she often threatens to end the relationship when she gets upset, causing stress for me.

Halloween night, we were having fun at my house.  I was trying to clean up before bed, but I was in a lot of pain due to a back injury. I commented ""I feel like a maid."" She instantly got upset. I calmed her down and apologized, telling her I'm  in pain so everything feels harder than normal.

She asked for a ride to get clothes for work the next day, but I'd been drinking and didn't feel safe driving. She said she felt fine, asking to drive my car instead. I agreed, telling her to text me when she was on her way back. She took all her things with her, which seemed odd since she coming back.

After falling asleep briefly, I woke up to find her gone and a text saying she wouldn't be returning my car, but would pick me up for work in the morning. I tried calling her but it went straight to voicemail and she wasn't answering my texts. With a spare car and house key, I decided to take an Uber to her apartment so we could talk. I quickly learned she suspended my access code to get into the apartment complex. I was locked out and unable to contact her. Feeling furious, I ended up driving my car back home, unable to resolve the situation.

She called me in the morning, upset because I was mad at her for taking my car. I explained she can't keep it without permission. I said ""you knew you weren't coming back when you took all her things last night."" Her response was ""so!"" I stated she should've taken an Uber instead. She angrily agreed to return my car and hung up on me. I decided to let her panic by not revealing that I already had the car.  

She called 38 times and texted repeatedly, asking if I had the car, but I ignored her. After 45 min, I called her revealing I had taken it last night to teach her a lesson. She was furious! Saying ""never contact me again, please get help!""

At this point she still had my car keys with my house/mail/parents' keys attached to them. Asking her to bring them back, she ignored me by putting her phone on do not disturb. I warned her I'd call the police if she didn't return them. After waiting and getting no response, I called the police to help. They couldn't come for hours due to being busy. Worried that she may have thrown my keys away, I changed the lock on my front door. Later that day, she returned my keys, including the spare key I gave her, leaving them on my doorstep. I only saw her back as she was leaving, but she seemed sad.

Am I the ass hole for trying to teach her a lesson? Would you have been upset if you were me?

The top comment was made by /u/KateCapella.",,NTA,"A year ago, my girlfriend and I met at work, but we've only been dating for 3 months. We became close after she experienced a traumatic event and I wanted to support her due to my own experience with abuse. We fell in love quickly despite our pasts. Although we both have trust issues, we're learning to communicate and work through our disagreements. However, she often threatens to end the relationship when she gets upset, causing stress for me.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I do not think the poster is the asshole here, and their girlfriend's actions were unjustified. Therefore, I put statement 1 (She stole your car and held your stuff hostage) at the top of the list, as it directly relates to the girlfriend's wrongdoing.

Statement 6 (She's not trustworthy and has more red flags than a warning sign) and 8 (You're lucky you didn't call the cops on her when she said she wasn't coming back that night) are also highly ranked because they highlight the girlfriend's untrustworthy behavior and the dangerous situation the poster was in.

Statement 10 (She needs professional help and anger management classes) is ranked higher because it suggests a solution for the girlfriend's behavior.

Statement 2 (The relationship is toxic and it's better that it ends) is ranked lower because it is a more general statement and does not directly relate to the girlfriend's actions.

Statement 9 (You both sound immature and shouldn't be in a relationship with anyone yet) and 11 (You both play too many games and it's better to end the relationship) are ranked lower because they suggest that both parties are at fault, which contradicts my comment.

Statement 4 (She was trying to teach you a lesson by lying and stealing your car) is ranked lower because it attempts to justify the girlfriend's actions, which I disagree with.

Statement 7 (You both fell in love because of unresolved trauma and need therapy) is ranked lower because it is a more general statement and does not directly relate to the girlfriend's actions.

Statement 3 (You could've called the police when she didn't return the car) is ranked lower because it suggests that the poster could have done something differently, which is not the main focus of my comment.

Statement 5 (You should have zero contact with her at work and consider looking for a new job) is ranked lower because it is a more specific solution that may not be necessary for the situation.

Statement 12 (She locked you out of her apartment to control the situation) is ranked last because it is a less significant action compared to stealing the car and holding the poster's stuff hostage."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe the relationship is unhealthy and recommend moving on from it. Therefore, I agree with statements that highlight the toxic and untrustworthy behavior of the girlfriend (1, 2, 6, 8, 4, 12). I also agree that both parties seem immature and should consider ending the relationship (9, 10, 11). However, I disagree with statements that suggest contacting the police or taking further action against the girlfriend (3, 5), as it would not be beneficial for either party in this situation. Lastly, I am neutral towards the statement about unresolved trauma and therapy (7) as it is a complex issue that requires professional help."

I agree with the statement ""She was trying to teach you a lesson by lying and stealing your car"" and ""You're lucky you didn't call the cops on her when she said she wasn't coming back that night"" because it shows that the girlfriend's plan backfired and she was not in a position to control the situation.

I put ""You could've called the police when she didn't return the car"" and ""She locked you out of her apartment to control the situation"" next because it shows that the girlfriend's actions were not justified and she was trying to manipulate the situation.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the relationship is toxic and it's better that it ends (statement 2). I also believe that both the partners seem immature and should not be in a relationship with anyone yet (statement 9). Statement 7 aligns with my view that both of them fell in love because of unresolved trauma and need therapy. Statement 11 also resonates with my opinion that they both play too many games. Statement 6 highlights the fact that she is not trustworthy and has more red flags than a warning sign, which further supports my view that the relationship should end. Statement 1 is a factual statement that she stole the car and held his stuff hostage, which I agree with. Statement 3, where it is suggested that the OP could have called the police when she didn't return the car, I partially agree with, but I think it's better to end the relationship than to take legal action. Statement 12, where it is mentioned that she locked him out of her apartment to control the situation, further highlights her untrustworthy and controlling behavior. Statement 10, where it is suggested that she needs professional help and anger management classes, I agree with, but I still think it's better to end the relationship. Statement 5, where it is suggested that the OP should have zero contact with her at work and consider looking for a new job, I partially agree with, but I think it's better to end the relationship first. Statement 4, where it is mentioned that she was trying to teach him a lesson by lying and stealing his car, I strongly disagree with and it's the least liked statement. Statement 8, where it is mentioned that the OP was lucky that he didn't call the cops on her when she said she wasn't coming back that night, I partially agree with, but I think it's better to end the relationship than to take legal action."

Therefore, I agree with statements 1, 3, and 8 which directly address her actions. Statement 6 also aligns with my view of her as not trustworthy. I also agree with statements 10 and 12, which suggest that she has anger management issues and plays games. Statement 4, while not directly addressing the girlfriend's actions, implies that she had a reason for stealing the car, which I do not agree with. Statements 9 and 2 suggest that both parties are at fault and the relationship is toxic, which I do not fully agree with as I believe the girlfriend's actions were unjustified. Statement 7 suggests that both parties have unresolved trauma and need therapy, which I do not fully agree with as it implies that both parties are equally at fault. Statement 5 suggests that the OP should cut off contact with the girlfriend at work and find a new job, which I do not agree with as it is an extreme measure and does not address the girlfriend's actions."

I also agree that the girlfriend was in the wrong for stealing the car and holding the poster's stuff hostage (statement 1). I think that the girlfriend was trying to control the situation by locking the poster out of her apartment (statement 12). I agree that the girlfriend needs professional help and anger management classes (statement 10) and that both the poster and the girlfriend are immature (statement 9).

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that the top priority is to establish boundaries and protect oneself from potential workplace hostility and untrustworthy behavior. Statements 5 and 6 align with this recommendation. Statements 1 and 8 highlight the severity of the girlfriend's actions, justifying the need for boundaries. Statements 10 and 11 suggest that both individuals in the relationship have issues that need to be addressed, further supporting the need for separation. Statement 2 suggests ending the relationship, which is in line with the other top-ranked statements. Statements 9 and 4 suggest immaturity and manipulation, respectively, which are also concerning but less urgent than the other top-ranked statements. Statement 12 provides additional context for the girlfriend's behavior, but it is less relevant to the recommendation of establishing boundaries and protecting oneself. Statement 3 suggests involving law enforcement, which may not be necessary or practical in this situation. Statement 7 suggests that both individuals have unresolved trauma, which is a valid point but does not directly address the immediate issue at hand."

Therefore, I agree with statement 1 the most, as it also highlights the severity of the action. Statement 8 is similar to my comment and I agree with it as well. Statement 3 is about calling the police, which I suggested, so I agree with it. Statement 6 highlights that she is not trustworthy, which I also mentioned. Statement 10 suggests that she needs professional help, which I can see as a possibility. Statement 12 mentions that she locked me out of her apartment, which is also a controlling behavior. I disagree with statement 4, as it tries to justify her actions. I also disagree with statement 9, as it implies that both of us are immature, which I don't think is entirely true. Statement 2, 5, and 11 are not directly related to the action of taking the car without permission, so I rank them lower.

Statement 2, 5, and 9 are less liked because they suggest that the relationship should end, which may not be necessary if the girlfriend is willing to take responsibility for her actions and make amends. Statement 4 and 7 are least liked because they suggest that the girlfriend's behavior was motivated by unresolved trauma or a desire to teach a lesson, which is not an acceptable excuse for stealing someone's car."

I rank the statements that suggest ending the relationship or seeking professional help higher, as I believe these are important steps for them to take. I rank the statement about teaching a lesson lower because it seems less important and less relevant to the overall situation. I rank the statement about calling the police lower because it seems like a more extreme measure that may not have been necessary in this situation.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that both the OP and their girlfriend are in the wrong, hence I ranked statement 1 (She stole your car and held your stuff hostage) as the most agreed upon statement. Statement 8 (You're lucky you didn't call the cops on her when she said she wasn't coming back that night) and statement 6 (She's not trustworthy and has more red flags than a warning sign) are also statements that I strongly agree with.

Statement 10 (She needs professional help and anger management classes) is a statement that I partially agree with, as it seems like both parties have some issues to work out.

Statement 12 (She locked you out of her apartment to control the situation) and statement 9 (You both sound immature and shouldn't be in a relationship with anyone yet) are statements that I agree with to some extent, but I believe that there are more pressing issues at hand. Statement 4 (She was trying to teach you a lesson by lying and stealing your car) is a statement that I disagree with, as it seems like a justification for her actions.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I am more concerned about the immediate issue of my girlfriend taking my car without permission and leaving the keys in a place where anyone could have entered the apartment. This is why statement 1 (She stole your car and held your stuff hostage) is at the top of my list. Statement 6 (She's not trustworthy and has more red flags than a warning sign) and 8 (You're lucky she didn't call the cops on her when she said she wasn't coming back that night) are also high on my list because they address the trust and safety issues in the relationship. Statement 4 (She was trying to teach you a lesson by lying and stealing your car) is also a serious issue, but I am not sure if this was the case, so it is lower on my list. Statement 10 (She needs professional help and anger management classes) and 11 (You both play too many games and it's better to end the relationship) are also concerning, but I am not sure if they are directly related to the incident with the car. Statement 9 (You both sound immature and shouldn't be in a relationship with anyone yet) and 7 (You both fell in love because of unresolved trauma and need therapy) are lower on my list because they are more general observations about the relationship. Statement 2 (The relationship is toxic and it's better that it ends) is at the bottom of my list because I am not ready to conclude that the relationship should end based on this one incident.

Statement 5 (You should have zero contact with her at work and consider looking for a new job) is at the bottom of my list because it seems like an extreme measure based on this one incident.

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that both individuals in this relationship have issues that need to be addressed, hence why I said ESH (Everyone Sucks Here). I put statement 2 (The relationship is toxic and it's better that it ends) at the top because it aligns with my belief that the relationship is unhealthy and should end. Statement 9 (You both sound immature and shouldn't be in a relationship with anyone yet) is also high up because it reinforces the idea that both individuals are not ready for a relationship.

Statement 1 (She stole your car and held your stuff hostage) is ranked higher because it highlights the unacceptable behavior of the girlfriend. Statement 6 (She's not trustworthy and has more red flags than a warning sign) and statement 8 (She's lucky you didn't call the cops on her when she said she wasn't coming back that night) are ranked high up because they further emphasize the girlfriend's untrustworthy and problematic behavior.

Statement 10 (She needs professional help and anger management classes) is ranked higher because it acknowledges the need for the girlfriend to seek professional help. Statement 4 (She was trying to teach you a lesson by lying and stealing your car) is ranked lower because it attempts to justify the girlfriend's actions, which I do not agree with.

Statement 12 (She locked you out of her apartment to control the situation) is ranked lower because it focuses on the controlling behavior of the girlfriend, which is not justification for her actions. Statement 3 (You could've called the police when she didn't return the car) is ranked lower because it places blame on the OP for not calling the police, which I do not agree with.

Statement 7 (You both fell in love because of unresolved trauma and need therapy) is ranked the lowest because it attempts to explain the behavior of both individuals as a result of unresolved trauma, which I do not agree with. Statement 5 (You should have zero contact with her at work and consider looking for a new job) is ranked the lowest because it suggests that the OP should avoid contact with the girlfriend at work, which I do not agree with."

Statement 6 aligns with my view of her being untrustworthy and having red flags. I also agree with statements 12 and 10, which suggest she needs professional help and anger management classes.

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe the girlfriend's actions are unjustified and she has exhibited multiple red flags. Therefore, I agree with the statements that highlight her wrongdoings and negative traits. I also agree with the statements that suggest taking action, such as cutting contact and seeking professional help. I disagree with the statements that suggest the relationship can be salvaged or that both parties share equal blame. I ranked the statements in the following order:

1. She stole your car and held your stuff hostage. - This is the most direct violation of the OP's rights and property.
2. The relationship is toxic and it's better that it ends. - The girlfriend's actions demonstrate a toxic and controlling dynamic.
3. She has more red flags than a Sith victory parade. - This statement reflects my comment and the overall sentiment of the comments.
4. You're lucky she didn't call the cops on you when she said she wasn't coming back that night. - This statement highlights the girlfriend's untrustworthiness and manipulative behavior.
5. She was trying to teach you a lesson by lying and stealing your car. - This statement implies that the girlfriend's actions were justified, which I disagree with.
6. She's not trustworthy and has more red flags than a warning sign. - This statement reinforces the girlfriend's negative traits.
7. She locked you out of her apartment to control the situation. - This statement further demonstrates the girlfriend's controlling behavior.
8. She needs professional help and anger management classes. - This statement acknowledges the girlfriend's need for help and improvement.
9. You both fell in love because of unresolved trauma and need therapy. - This statement implies shared blame, which I disagree with.
10. You both sound immature and shouldn't be in a relationship with anyone yet. - This statement implies shared blame, which I disagree with.
11. You could've called the police when she didn't return the car. - This statement suggests a possible course of action that the OP could have taken.
12. You should have zero contact with her at work and consider looking for a new job. - This statement suggests a possible course of action that the OP could have taken.
13. You both play too many games and it's better to end the relationship. - This statement implies shared blame, which I disagree with."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe the relationship is toxic and should end, which aligns with statement 2. Statement 6 also supports the toxicity of the relationship. Statement 8 highlights the fortunate circumstance that the police were not involved, and statement 1 emphasizes the wrongfulness of stealing the car. Statement 4 suggests the girlfriend was trying to teach a lesson, but this does not justify her actions. Statement 12 highlights her attempt to control the situation, which is a negative behavior. Statement 3 suggests involving the police, which I do not support but acknowledge as an option. Statement 10 suggests the girlfriend needs professional help, which I agree with. Statement 9 implies immaturity from both parties, which I can see but do not think is the main issue here. Statement 5 suggests cutting off contact at work, which I see as an extreme measure at this point. Statement 7 suggests unresolved trauma as the reason for falling in love, which I think is worth considering but not a priority. Statement 11 suggests playing games, which I can see but do not think is the main issue."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe the girlfriend is in the wrong for taking the car without permission and holding the OP's stuff hostage (statement 1). I also agree that the OP was not wrong for taking the car back (statement 8). I think the girlfriend's actions were insane and she was trying to teach the OP a lesson by lying and stealing the car (statements 4 and 10). She also showed a lack of trustworthiness and need for anger management (statements 6 and 10). I believe the relationship may be toxic and both parties may need therapy (statements 2, 9, and 7). I disagree with the statements suggesting that the OP should have called the police (statement 3) or cut off all contact with the girlfriend at work (statement 5) as they do not seem necessary based on the information provided. Statement 12 about the girlfriend locking the OP out of her apartment is less important than the other statements in my opinion."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe the girlfriend was in the wrong and the relationship is better off ending. I agree with statements 2, 6, 8, and 12, which highlight the girlfriend's wrongdoing and untrustworthy behavior. Statement 1, which also mentions her wrongdoing, is less strongly worded, so it comes after the previous statements. Statement 12, about controlling the situation, is less important than the previous statements, so it comes next.

Statements 9 and 3 both suggest immaturity and a lack of responsibility, which I agree with, but they are less important than the previous statements, so they come next. Statement 11, about playing games, is similar to statement 12, but less directly related to the situation, so it comes after statement 12.

Statement 10, about needing professional help and anger management, is less important than the previous statements, as it is more speculative and less directly related to the situation. Statement 4, about teaching a lesson, is less likely and less important than the previous statements, so it comes next.

Statement 5, about zero contact at work, is less important than the previous statements, as it is more specific to the situation and less generally applicable. Statement 7, about unresolved trauma, is speculative and less important than the previous statements, so it comes last."

Therefore, I agree with statements 1, 3, 6, 8, and 10 which directly criticize her actions. Statement 12 is also high up because it implies that both parties play games and should end the relationship. Statement 2 is further down because it implies that the relationship is toxic, but it doesn't directly address the girlfriend's actions. Statements 9, 7, and 5 are lower because they suggest that both parties are immature or have unresolved issues, but they don't directly address the girlfriend's actions.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that both individuals in this relationship have unresolved trauma (7) and need therapy (7, 10). I think that she was wrong for stealing the car (1, 6, 8), and she is not trustworthy (6, 8). I also agree that she needs professional help and anger management classes (10).

I also disagree with statement 9, which implies that both parties are immature, as my comment suggests that the girlfriend is the one at fault.

Statement 1 mentions stealing the car, which is a violation of trust. Statement 12 highlights controlling behavior, which is a sign of toxicity. Statement 10 suggests professional help, which is a step towards healing. Statement 4 implies a lesson through lying and stealing, which is manipulative. Statement 11 suggests playing games, which is immature and unhealthy. Statement 3 suggests calling the police, which I don't fully agree with as it could escalate the situation. Statement 5 suggests no contact at work, which is a step towards separation but not the main issue. Statement 9 implies immaturity, which is a broader issue not specific to this incident."

Statements 6, 8, and 9 align with my view that the relationship is unhealthy and both individuals need to take a step back and evaluate their actions. Statement 11 also highlights the game-playing behavior that I mentioned in my comment. I ranked statements 4 and 12 lower because they attempt to justify her actions, which I do not agree with. Statements 2, 10, and 3 were ranked lower because they suggest more drastic actions or blame one individual over the other.

The girlfriend's actions are unacceptable and she should be held accountable for her actions.

The statement ""You could've called the police when she didn't return the car"" is ranked high because it suggests that the OP should have taken action to protect his property and safety.

The statement ""She was trying to teach you a lesson by lying and stealing your car"" is ranked high because it highlights the manipulative behavior of the girlfriend. The statement ""She needs professional help and anger management classes"" is ranked high because it suggests that the girlfriend has deeper issues that need to be addressed.

The statement ""She locked you out of her apartment to control the situation"" is ranked high because it highlights the controlling behavior of the girlfriend. The statement ""You should have zero contact with her at work and consider looking for a new job"" is ranked high because it suggests that the OP should take steps to protect himself from the girlfriend's behavior.

The statement ""You both fell in love because of unresolved trauma and need therapy"" is ranked low because it suggests that both the OP and the girlfriend have issues that need to be addressed, but it does not excuse the girlfriend's behavior.

The statement ""The relationship is toxic and it's better that it ends"" is ranked low because it suggests that the relationship should end, but it does not address the girlfriend's behavior.

I ranked statement 1 (She stole your car and held your stuff hostage) as the most agreed upon because it directly relates to the description and is a clear violation of trust. Statement 6 (She's not trustworthy and has more red flags than a warning sign) and 8 (You're lucky you didn't call the cops on her when she said she wasn't coming back that night) are also highly agreed upon as they address the lack of trust and the seriousness of the situation. Statement 4 (She was trying to teach you a lesson by lying and stealing your car) is ranked lower because it assumes her intentions, which are not clear from the description. Statement 10 (She needs professional help and anger management classes) is ranked lower as it is a more extreme solution and assumes she has anger issues. Statement 12 (She locked you out of her apartment to control the situation) is ranked lower as it is a less severe action compared to stealing a car. Statement 3 (You could've called the police when she didn't return the car) is ranked lower because it suggests a more aggressive response that may not have been necessary. Statement 9 (You both sound immature and shouldn't be in a relationship with anyone yet) and 11 (You both play too many games and it's better to end the relationship) are ranked lower because they are more general statements that don't directly relate to the situation. Statement 2 (The relationship is toxic and it's better that it ends) is ranked last because it is a more extreme solution and assumes the relationship is beyond repair. Statement 7 (You both fell in love because of unresolved trauma and need therapy) is ranked last because it is a speculative statement that doesn't directly relate to the situation. Statement 5 (You should have zero contact with her at work and consider looking for a new job) is ranked last because it is a more extreme solution that assumes the situation cannot be resolved."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the girlfriend's actions of stealing the car and holding the op's stuff hostage are the most asshole-ish actions (1). I also think that the girlfriend was trying to teach the op a lesson (4), which is still a shitty thing to do. The op should have called the police when she didn't return the car (8), and the girlfriend definitely needs professional help and anger management classes (10). I agree with the statement that the girlfriend is not trustworthy and has more red flags than a warning sign (6), and that both the op and the girlfriend sound immature and shouldn't be in a relationship with anyone yet (9). I also agree that the girlfriend locked the op out of her apartment to control the situation (12).

The relationship being toxic and it being better that it ends (2) is a valid point, but I think it's less asshole-ish than the other statements. I also think that the op and the girlfriend fell in love because of unresolved trauma and need therapy (7), but it's not as asshole-ish as the other statements. I disagree with the statement that the op could have called the police when she didn't return the car (3), because it would have escalated the situation unnecessarily. I also disagree with the statement that the op should have zero contact with her at work and consider looking for a new job (5), because it's not clear from the description that the girlfriend is a coworker. Lastly, I disagree with the statement that they both play too many games and it's better to end the relationship (11), because it's not clear from the description that they are playing games."

REASONING = Based on the comment, both the OP and his girlfriend are at fault (ESH). The most liked statement is that the relationship is toxic and it's better that it ends (2), as it aligns with the ESH stance. Statements 4, 6, and 8 highlight the girlfriend's untrustworthy and controlling behavior, which the OP also acknowledges in the comment. Statement 1 is partially agreed upon, as the girlfriend did steal the car without permission. Statement 12 is also agreed upon, as the girlfriend locked the OP out of her apartment. Statements 10 and 9 are agreed upon to a lesser extent, as the girlfriend may need therapy and anger management classes, and both the OP and his girlfriend may be immature. Statement 5 is agreed upon, as the OP should limit contact with his girlfriend at work and consider finding a new job. Statement 7 is partially agreed upon, as the OP and his girlfriend may have fallen in love due to unresolved trauma. Statement 3 is the least agreed upon, as the OP did not mention calling the police when the girlfriend did not return the car."

Statement 11 comes next because they both play games (11). Statement 7 is next because they fell in love due to unresolved trauma (7).

REASONING = Based on my comment, I think the relationship might not be completely toxic and there is still a chance to save it. Therefore, statement 2, ""The relationship is toxic and it's better that it ends."" is ranked first. Statement 6, ""She's not trustworthy and has more red flags than a warning sign."" and statement 8, ""You're lucky you didn't call the cops on her when she said she wasn't coming back that night."" are ranked high because they highlight the trust issues in the relationship. Statement 1, ""She stole your car and held your stuff hostage."" is ranked next because it is a serious violation of trust. Statement 4, ""She was trying to teach you a lesson by lying and stealing your car."" is ranked lower because it implies that there might be some underlying issues that need to be addressed. Statement 11, ""You both play too many games and it's better to end the relationship."" and statement 9, ""You both sound immature and shouldn't be in a relationship with anyone yet."" are ranked next because they suggest that both parties need to take responsibility for their actions and grow up. Statement 12, ""She locked you out of her apartment to control the situation."" is ranked lower because it implies a power imbalance in the relationship. Statement 3, ""You could've called the police when she didn't return the car."" is ranked low because it's a reactionary measure and might escalate the situation. Statement 10, ""She needs professional help and anger management classes."" and statement 5, ""She should have zero contact with you at work and consider looking for a new job."" are ranked last because they imply that the relationship is beyond repair and focus on individual issues rather than the relationship as a whole."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I do not think the girlfriend is an asshole here, and it seems like both parties have unresolved trauma (7). I agree with statement 2 because the relationship seems to be toxic, but I am not sure if ending it is the best solution (2). I agree with statements 6, 8, and 10, which highlight the girlfriend's untrustworthy behavior and need for professional help (6, 8, 10). I also agree with statement 11, which suggests that both parties play games in the relationship (11). I agree with statement 4, but I think the girlfriend was trying to teach a lesson rather than stealing (4). I agree with statement 1, which suggests that the girlfriend stole the car, but I do not think it is the most important issue here (1). I agree with statement 12, but I think it is less important than the other statements (12). I do not agree with statement 5, which suggests cutting off contact with the girlfriend at work, because it may not be feasible or necessary (5). I do not agree with statement 3, which suggests calling the police, because it seems like an overreaction based on the information provided (3). I do not agree with statement 9, which suggests that both parties are immature, because it is a judgmental statement and does not address the specific issue at hand (9)."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that the girlfriend's actions of taking the car without permission and not returning it on time were wrong, so I agree with statements 3 and 8. Statement 1 is also in line with my comment. Statement 6 highlights the girlfriend's untrustworthy behavior, which I also mentioned in my comment. Statement 10 suggests that the girlfriend needs professional help, which I can see as a possibility given her actions. Statement 12 highlights the controlling behavior of the girlfriend, which I also mentioned in my comment. I disagree with statement 2, as I don't think the relationship should end based solely on this incident. Statement 9 suggests that both parties are immature, which I can see as a possibility but I don't think it's the main issue here. Statement 4 suggests that the girlfriend was trying to teach a lesson, which I don't think is an acceptable excuse for her actions. Statement 5 suggests cutting off contact with the girlfriend at work, which I don't think is necessary based on the information provided. Statement 7 suggests that both parties fell in love because of unresolved trauma, which I can see as a possibility but I don't think it's the main issue here."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the girlfriend is in the wrong here and the relationship is better off ending. I agree with statement 1 the most since she took the car without permission and held his stuff hostage. Statement 2 follows closely since the relationship is indeed toxic. Statement 6 highlights her untrustworthiness and red flags, which I also agree with. Statement 8 points out that the girlfriend is lucky that the police weren't called, which I also think is true. Statement 10 suggests that she needs professional help and anger management classes, which I agree with. Statement 4 implies that she was trying to teach a lesson by lying and stealing the car, which I disagree with since it's not an appropriate way to teach a lesson. Statement 12 mentions that she locked him out of her apartment to control the situation, which I agree with. Statement 3 suggests that the OP could have called the police, which I disagree with since it seems like the situation has already been resolved. Statement 9 implies that both the OP and the girlfriend are immature, which I partially agree with. Statement 7 suggests that they both fell in love because of unresolved trauma and need therapy, which I disagree with since it seems like the girlfriend is the one with the issues. Statement 5 suggests that the OP should have zero contact with her at work and consider looking for a new job, which I disagree with since it seems like an overreaction. Statement 11 implies that they both play too many games, which I partially agree with."

REASONING: Based on the comment ""And she will take everything from you"", it is clear that the commentor perceives the girlfriend's actions as a warning sign for future behavior. Therefore, statements that highlight the girlfriend's negative actions and their potential consequences are ranked higher. Statement 1, ""She stole your car and held your stuff hostage,"" is ranked first as it directly relates to the girlfriend's actions and their impact on the commentor. Statement 6, ""She's not trustworthy and has more red flags than a warning sign,"" is ranked second as it reinforces the commentor's perception of the girlfriend's character. Statement 8, ""You're lucky you didn't call the cops on her when she said she wasn't coming back that night,"" is ranked third as it highlights the potential consequences of the girlfriend's actions. Statement 3, ""You could've called the police when she didn't return the car,"" is ranked fourth as it suggests a possible course of action that the commentor could have taken. Statement 10, ""She needs professional help and anger management classes,"" is ranked fifth as it implies that the girlfriend's behavior is a result of deeper issues that need to be addressed. Statement 2, ""The relationship is toxic and it's better that it ends,"" is ranked sixth as it suggests a potential solution to the problem. Statement 9, ""You both sound immature and shouldn't be in a relationship with anyone yet,"" is ranked seventh as it implies that both parties are at fault. Statement 12, ""She locked you out of her apartment to control the situation,"" is ranked eighth as it highlights the girlfriend's manipulative behavior. Statement 4, ""She was trying to teach you a lesson by lying and stealing your car,"" is ranked ninth as it implies that the girlfriend's actions were premeditated. Statement 7, ""You both fell in love because of unresolved trauma and need therapy,"" is ranked tenth as it suggests a deeper underlying issue that needs to be addressed. Statement 5, ""You should have zero contact with her at work and consider looking for a new job,"" is ranked eleventh as it implies that the situation has become untenable. Statement 11, ""You both play too many games and it's better to end the relationship,"" is ranked twelfth as it suggests that both parties are contributing to the problem."

Therefore, I agree with statements 1, 2, 6, 10, and 8, which highlight her untrustworthy and harmful behavior. Statement 4 implies that she was trying to teach a lesson, but I believe it was a harmful and controlling action. Statement 12 also highlights her controlling behavior by locking the OP out of her apartment. Statements 9 and 11 suggest that both parties are immature and play games, but I believe the girlfriend's actions are more severe. Statement 3 suggests calling the police, which I considered but did not include in my comment. Statement 7 suggests that both parties have unresolved trauma, but I believe the girlfriend needs more immediate help.

Statement 6 is ranked high because it emphasizes the girlfriend's lack of trustworthiness, which I also mentioned in my comment. Statement 2 is ranked high because it acknowledges that the relationship is toxic and it's better to end it, which I agree with. Statement 4 is ranked lower because it suggests that the girlfriend was trying to teach the OP a lesson, which I don't think justifies her actions. Statement 12 is ranked lower because it implies that both the OP and the girlfriend play games, which I don't think is entirely accurate. Statement 9 is ranked low because it suggests that both the OP and the girlfriend are immature, which I don't think is entirely fair. Statement 10 is ranked low because it suggests that the girlfriend needs professional help and anger management classes, which I don't think is the OP's responsibility to address. Statement 3 is ranked low because it suggests that the OP could have called the police, which I don't think is necessary in this situation. Statement 5 is ranked low because it suggests that the OP should have zero contact with the girlfriend at work and consider looking for a new job, which I don't think is necessary in this situation.

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that the girlfriend's actions of taking the car without permission, locking the OP out of her apartment, and not answering calls are clear signs of untrustworthiness and manipulation (1, 6, 12). I also think that the OP should have considered calling the police when the car was not returned (3, 8). The relationship seems toxic and it's better to end it (2, 11). The girlfriend may have some anger issues and needs professional help (10). Both the OP and the girlfriend seem immature and not ready for a relationship (9, 11). The girlfriend's actions can be seen as a lesson or a way to control the situation (4), but this does not excuse her behavior. The OP should have zero contact with her at work and consider finding a new job (5). The relationship may have started due to unresolved trauma (7), but this does not justify the girlfriend's actions. The statement about teaching a lesson (4) is ranked lower because it implies that the girlfriend's behavior was justified, which I do not agree with. The statement about calling the police (3) is ranked lower because it was not necessary in this situation, but it could have been considered. The statement about the relationship being toxic (2) is ranked lower because it is a more general statement and does not directly address the girlfriend's actions. The statement about the girlfriend not being alone at her apartment (my speculation) is not included in the ranking because it is not based on the information provided in the post or the other comments."

Statement 10 suggests that the girlfriend needs professional help, which I agree with. Statement 4, while not directly aligning with my view, still implies that the girlfriend acted inappropriately. Statement 9 suggests that both parties are immature, which I partially agree with. Statement 12 implies that the girlfriend was trying to control the situation, which I also agree with. Statement 3 suggests that the OP could have called the police, but I don't think it's necessary to rank it higher since I don't think it's the best course of action in this situation. Statement 7, while potentially true, doesn't seem relevant to the situation at hand and I don't think it should be ranked highly.

REASONING: Based on the comment, both the poster and their girlfriend are at fault for playing games in their relationship. However, the girlfriend's actions of taking the car without permission and holding the poster's stuff hostage are unacceptable (1st statement). The poster made the right decision by not calling the police when she didn't return the car (8th statement), but they should have considered it (3rd statement). The girlfriend's actions show that she is not trustworthy and has red flags (6th statement), and she locked the poster out of her apartment to control the situation (12th statement). Both the poster and their girlfriend sound immature and should not be in a relationship (9th statement), and the girlfriend needs professional help and anger management classes (10th statement). The girlfriend was trying to teach the poster a lesson by lying and stealing the car (4th statement), which is not an appropriate way to handle a situation. The relationship is toxic and it's better that it ends (2nd statement), but the poster should have zero contact with her at work and consider looking for a new job (5th statement) to avoid further conflicts. Lastly, the poster mentioned that they both fell in love because of unresolved trauma and need therapy (7th statement), which is a valid point, but it's not justification for the girlfriend's actions."

Statement 9 (You both sound immature and shouldn't be in a relationship with anyone yet.) is also in line with my comment and is placed second.

Statement 8 (She's lucky you didn't call the cops on her when she said she wasn't coming back that night.) is placed fourth, as it highlights the girlfriend's irresponsible behavior. Statement 6 (She's not trustworthy and has more red flags than a warning sign.) is placed fifth, as it further emphasizes the lack of trust in the relationship. Statement 4 (She was trying to teach you a lesson by lying and stealing your car.) is placed sixth, as it suggests a manipulative behavior from the girlfriend. Statement 11 (You both play too many games and it's better to end the relationship.) is placed seventh, as it highlights the unhealthy dynamics in the relationship. Statement 12 (She locked you out of her apartment to control the situation.) is placed eighth, as it further emphasizes the controlling behavior of the girlfriend.

Statement 7 (You both fell in love because of unresolved trauma and need therapy.) is placed eleventh, as it suggests a deeper underlying issue that may not be fully addressed.

Now we are in a fight and he says he will not cook for me anymore because I didn't provide him with a complete breakfast. I actually cracked one egg and asked him to do his other one.

My spouse asked me to make him some this morning. I made him the eggs in an egg cooker. Toasted him his toast and said it was ready. I left him in charge of his egg cracking, so I wouldn't have to hear about the shells. Now we are in a fight and he says he will not cook for me anymore because I didn't provide him with a complete breakfast. I actually cracked one egg and asked him to do his other one. Instead of doing that he only ate the egg I put on his toast and the other toast on top. Never cracked his own egg. AITAH?",

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that the husband is being unreasonable and petty (7), and the main issue is not about the eggs but about the relationship (4, 10). However, I also agree that it's important to make an effort to remove eggshells (1, 5) and that it's not hard to crack an egg properly (6). Additionally, I think that the person making the eggs should ensure they are edible and free of shell fragments (2, 5), and that the husband should not expect his wife to cook for him if he's not willing to do the same (9). I also think that the wife should make an effort to improve her cooking (8), but I believe that the husband should also crack his own eggs if he has a problem with the way they're made (3). Overall, I think that the husband is being unreasonable and that both parties should make an effort to consider each other's needs and preferences."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that both the husband and wife are at fault here. I think the wife (referred to as ""you"" in my comment) should make an effort to crack the eggs properly and remove shell fragments (statement 8). I also agree that it's not hard to crack an egg without getting shell in it and it's a basic life skill (statement 6). The person serving the eggs should ensure they are edible and free of shell fragments (statement 5), and it's not normal to eat bits of eggshell in eggs (statement 2). I think the husband is being petty and unreasonable in his expectations (statement 7), but I also believe that the husband should crack his own eggs if he has a problem with the way they're made (statement 3). I agree with statement 1 that the person making eggs should make an effort to remove the shell. I think statement 4 (The issue is not about the eggs, but about the relationship) and statement 10 (The issue is about the lack of effort and consideration in the relationship, not just about the eggs) are less relevant to the situation, as the main issue seems to be about the eggs and the lack of effort put into making them properly. Statement 9 (The husband should not expect his wife to cook for him if he's not willing to do the same for her) is not directly related to the situation at hand, as it seems that both the husband and wife are expecting certain things from each other in regards to cooking."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that the husband is not unreasonable for not wanting to eat eggshells (2, 6), and it is the wife's responsibility to ensure the eggs are edible (1, 5). However, I also think that the husband should crack his own eggs if he has a problem with the way they're made (3, 7), and the wife should make an effort to improve her cooking (8). The issue is not just about the eggs, but about the relationship and the lack of effort and consideration (10, 9), but I still think the husband is being more unreasonable than the wife (4)."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that the issue is not just about the eggs but about the relationship as a whole (4). The husband being unreasonable and the lack of effort and consideration in the relationship are also significant factors (7, 10). The issue of eggshells in the eggs is not normal, but it's not the root cause of the problem (2). Ensuring the edibility of the eggs and making an effort to remove shell fragments are important (1, 5). While it's a basic life skill to crack an egg without getting shell in it (6), the husband should also consider cracking his own eggs (3). The husband should not expect his wife to cook for him if he's not willing to do the same (9), and the wife should learn to crack eggs properly (8), but these statements are less important than addressing the underlying issues in the relationship."

I also agree that it's not normal to eat bits of eggshell in eggs (2) and that the husband should not expect his wife to cook for him if he's not willing to do the same for her (9). I slightly agree that the person making eggs should make an effort to remove the shell (1) and that it's not hard to crack an egg without getting shell in it (6). I disagree with the husband being petty and unreasonable in his expectations (7) because I believe that the wife should learn to crack eggs properly and make an effort to improve her cooking (8). I also think that the issue is not just about the eggs, but about the relationship (4, 10). The statement ""The issue is about the lack of effort and consideration in the relationship, not just about the eggs"" (10) is very similar to my comment, but I still rank it lower because it doesn't specifically address the eggshell issue. The statement ""The husband should crack his own eggs if he has a problem with the way they're made"" (3) is also similar to my comment, but I rank it lower because it doesn't address the issue of ensuring the eggs are edible. The statement ""It's a basic life skill"" (6) is redundant and less specific than the statement ""It's not hard to crack an egg without getting shell in it"" (6), so I rank it lower.

Statement 7, which calls the husband petty, is third, as it shows that the husband's behavior is not reasonable.

Statement 1, which states that the person making eggs should make an effort to remove the shell, is fifth, as it shows that some effort should be made in cooking the eggs. Statement 6, which states that it's not hard to crack an egg without getting shell in it, is sixth, as it shows that the husband's expectations may be too high. Statement 2, which states that it's not normal to eat bits of eggshell in eggs, is seventh, as it shows that the husband's complaint is valid but not the main issue. Statement 3, which states that the husband should crack his own eggs if he has a problem with the way they're made, is eighth, as it shows that the husband should also take some responsibility. Statement 8, which states that the wife should learn to crack eggs properly and make an effort to improve her cooking, is ninth, as it shows that the wife should also make some effort but not at the expense of the relationship. Statement 9, which states that the husband should not expect his wife to cook for him if he's not willing to do the same for her, is last, as it shows that the issue is not just about the eggs but about the lack of effort and consideration in the relationship."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I strongly agree with statement 5, as the person serving eggs should ensure they are edible and free of shell fragments. Statement 1 and 2 also resonate with me, as it is important to make an effort to remove eggshells and it's not normal to eat bits of eggshell in eggs. Statement 6 is also relevant, as cracking an egg without getting shell in it is a basic life skill. I agree with statement 8 to some extent, as the wife should learn to crack eggs properly, but I also believe that the husband should be more understanding and not expect his wife to cook for him if he's not willing to do the same for her (statement 9). Statement 7 and 3 are less agreeable, as the husband is being petty and unreasonable in his expectations, but the husband should also crack his own eggs if he has a problem with the way they're made. Statement 4 and 10 are least agreeable, as the issue is not just about the eggs, but about the lack of effort and consideration in the relationship, and the relationship dynamics are not the main focus of the post."

Statement 10, which also touches upon the relationship aspect, is second. Statement 7, which states the husband is being unreasonable, is agreed upon next. Statement 5, which is about ensuring the edibility of the eggs, is agreed upon next. Statement 1, which is about removing shells, is agreed upon next. Statement 6, which states that cracking an egg without shells is a basic life skill, is agreed upon next. Statement 3, which suggests the husband should crack his own eggs, is agreed upon next.

REASONING = Based on my comment, I am primarily focused on the issue of eggshells in the eggs. Statement 2 is most aligned with my comment as it directly states that eating eggshells is not normal. Statement 6 also agrees with this, emphasizing that cracking an egg without getting shell in it is a basic life skill. Statement 1 and 5 are next in line as they both suggest that the person making eggs should make an effort to remove the shell and ensure they are edible. Statement 3 and 7 are less relevant to my comment but still somewhat agree, suggesting that the husband should crack his own eggs or that he is being unreasonable. Statement 8 is similar but more directly critical of the wife's egg-cracking skills. Statement 4 and 9 shift the focus away from the eggs and towards the relationship, which is less relevant to my comment. Statement 10 is the least relevant as it summarizes multiple points and does not specifically address eggshells."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the main issue is not about the eggshells, but about the lack of effort and consideration in the relationship. Therefore, statement 5, which emphasizes the responsibility of the person serving the eggs to ensure they are edible and free of shell fragments, is the most agreed upon. Statement 1, which agrees that some effort should be made to remove the shell, is also agreed upon. Statement 2, which states that it's not normal to eat bits of eggshell in eggs, is also agreed upon. Statement 6, which mentions that it's not hard to crack an egg without getting shell in it, is agreed upon as it is a basic life skill. Statement 8, which suggests that the wife should learn to crack eggs properly and make an effort to improve her cooking, is agreed upon, but it is not the main issue. Statement 4, which frames the issue as being about the relationship, is agreed upon. Statement 10, which reiterates that the issue is about the lack of effort and consideration in the relationship, is agreed upon. Statement 9, which suggests that the husband should not expect his wife to cook for him if he's not willing to do the same for her, is agreed upon. Statement 3, which suggests that the husband should crack his own eggs if he has a problem with the way they're made, is not the main issue and is therefore ranked lower.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly believe that it's not difficult to crack an egg without getting shells in it, and it's a basic life skill (statement 6). I also agree that eating bits of eggshell in eggs is not normal (statement 2), and the person making eggs should make an effort to remove the shell (statement 1). I think the person serving eggs should ensure they are edible and free of shell fragments (statement 5).

I disagree with statements 7, 3, and 8, which blame the husband or wife for the situation. My comment suggests that the issue is not about the individuals but about the expectation of one person to do all the cooking (statement 9). I also think that the issue is about the lack of effort and consideration in the relationship (statement 10), not just about the eggs.

Statement 4, which focuses on the relationship, is less relevant to my comment, and I rank it lower. Statement 9, which suggests that the husband should not expect his wife to cook for him, is more relevant but still not as important as the basic life skill of cracking eggs properly.

Overall, my ranking prioritizes the importance of basic life skills, the need for effort and consideration in relationships, and the responsibility of the person making and serving the eggs."

Statements 2 and 6 also agree with the husband's expectation of not having eggshells in his eggs. Statements 1 and 5 suggest that the person making eggs should make an effort to remove shells and ensure edibility, which aligns with the general consensus. Statement 10 agrees with statement 4, that the issue is not just about the eggs, but about the relationship. Statement 3 suggests that the husband should crack his own eggs, which is not a popular opinion. Statement 8 suggests that the wife should learn to crack eggs properly, which is also not a popular opinion. Statement 9, suggesting that the husband should not expect his wife to cook for him if he's not willing to do the same, is the least agreed upon statement as it shifts the focus away from the main issue of eggshells in the eggs."

I also think it's important for the wife to make an effort to crack eggs properly, so I agree with statements 5 and 1. Statement 2 is true, but not the main issue here, so it's lower in the ranking.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I strongly believe that cracking eggs without getting shells in them is a basic life skill (statement 6). The person making eggs should make an effort to remove the shell (statement 1) and ensure the eggs are edible and free of shell fragments (statement 5). I also think it's not hard to crack an egg properly (statement 2).

The husband being petty and unreasonable in his expectations (statement 7) and the husband should crack his own eggs (statement 3) are also valid points. However, I believe the issue goes beyond the eggs and is about the relationship (statements 4, 9, and 10). The wife should learn to crack eggs properly and make an effort to improve her cooking (statement 8), but the husband should not expect his wife to cook for him if he's not willing to do the same for her (statement 9).

In summary, the primary issue is the lack of basic life skills and effort in cracking eggs, but the underlying problem lies in the relationship dynamics."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe the husband is being unreasonable and petty, so I agree with statement 7 the most. Statement 3 also aligns with my stance, as I think the husband should crack his own eggs if he has a problem with the way they're made. I agree with statement 6 because it's not difficult to crack an egg without getting shell in it. Statement 1 is less important but still somewhat agreeable, as the person making eggs should make an effort to remove the shell. Statement 5 is in line with my thinking, as the person serving eggs should ensure they are edible and free of shell fragments. Statement 2 is less relevant, but I still agree with it because it's not normal to eat bits of eggshell in eggs. Statement 4 is not directly related to the issue, but I can see how it could be a factor in the relationship. Statement 9 is partially agreeable, as the husband should not expect his wife to cook for him if he's not willing to do the same for her. Statement 8 is the least agreeable, as I don't think the wife should be solely responsible for improving her cooking. Statement 10 is not directly relevant to the issue, so it goes last."

Statement 7 highlights the difference between meeting family and hanging out with a friend, which I agree with and rank third. Statement 5 is ranked fourth because the wife should have communicated her feelings and concerns instead of faking sickness. Statement 2 is ranked fifth because while the wife's accusation of cheating may indicate projection, it is not clear from the information provided. Statement 4 is ranked sixth because the wife's behavior is suspicious, but it is not clear if she was using her sickness as an excuse. Statement 10 is ranked seventh because the wife's behavior and accusations may indicate gaslighting, but it is not clear from the information provided. Statement 8 is ranked eighth because it is possible that the wife was using her sickness as an excuse to meet her friend, but it is not clear from the information provided. Statement 9 is ranked ninth because it is not clear from the information provided if the wife's friend and their relationship are suspicious.

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe the wife's behavior is suspicious and possibly indicative of cheating. Therefore, I agree with statements 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, which highlight her suspicious behavior and lack of communication. Statement 1, while not fully supporting the wife, suggests that she may have been too sick to meet the family, which I disagree with based on her ability to meet her friend. Statement 8, while similar to 1, includes the possibility of using sickness as an excuse to meet her friend, which aligns more with my suspicion of her cheating. Statement 10, which I also agree with, points out the possibility of gaslighting, which is a common tactic used by cheaters. Statement 9, while not directly related to my suspicion of cheating, suggests investigating her friend and their relationship, which I agree with as it may provide more information about the situation. Statement 3, which I disagree with, suggests that the husband was controlling by not letting the wife meet the family, but I believe the husband had valid concerns based on the wife's behavior. Statement 6, which I also disagree with, suggests that the husband should have addressed his feelings and concerns in a more adult manner, but I believe the husband's actions were justified given the suspicious behavior of the wife."

The next statements (9, 4, 5) suggest investigating her friend and their relationship, and the wife's potential nervousness or using sickness as an excuse to meet her friend. These statements are ranked higher because they support the idea of the wife's suspicious behavior.

These statements are ranked lower because they are less relevant to the suspicion of gaslighting.

The OP was not controlling or petty by not letting her meet the family (3), and the situation calls for addressing feelings and concerns in a more adult manner (6, 9). Investigating the friend and their relationship (9) is not a priority at this point."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe the wife is not telling the truth about being sick and is instead meeting her friend or possibly cheating. Statement 2 aligns with this the most as it mentions the possibility of her accusations being a form of projection due to her own actions. Statement 5 is about communication, which the wife failed to do. Statement 7 highlights the difference between meeting a friend and meeting family, which the wife doesn't seem to understand. Statement 3 is less likely, but still possible, and is included after the more likely statements. Statement 1 is included because, while the wife was not sick, she may have had a valid reason for not wanting to meet the family. Statement 4 is less likely, but still possible. Statement 10 is included because the wife's behavior and accusations are suspicious and could be a form of gaslighting. Statement 8 is included because it aligns with the possibility of the wife meeting her friend. Statement 9 is included because, while it is the least likely, it is still a possibility that should be considered. Statement 6 is included last because it is the least relevant to the situation."

Yes, her staying out until 1 AM after feeling sick all week was kind of rude. But it also sounds like U2 just don’t communicate well. What was the point of you not allowing her to see your family the next day? If you were upset with her about staying out until 1 AM, maybe you could’ve communicated that with her. Also, couldn’t you have communicated with her while she was out and said hey if you’re out with your friend, how about come meet me and my dad and join us for a little bit as well. Since you were out late with your dad as well.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that both the poster (U2) and their wife are at fault for not communicating effectively. However, I think that U2 was more in the wrong for being petty and controlling by not allowing their wife to meet their family for breakfast (statement 3). I also agree with statements 5 and 7, which suggest that the wife should have communicated her feelings and concerns about meeting the family, and that there is a difference between a low-energy hangout with a friend and meeting new family for the first time. Statement 1, which points out that the wife was sick but still went out to meet a friend, is less important but still relevant. Statement 8, which suggests that the wife might have been using her sickness as an excuse to meet her friend, is less likely but still possible. Statement 4, which suggests that the wife might have been nervous about meeting the family, is plausible but not directly relevant to the situation at hand. Statement 10, which suggests that the wife's behavior and accusations are suspicious and might indicate gaslighting, is the least likely of all the statements, and I would need more information to make a judgement on that. Statement 2, which suggests that the wife's accusation of cheating is a projection, is also less likely and less relevant. Statement 9, which suggests that U2 should investigate the wife's friend and their relationship, is the least relevant statement of all, and seems to be based on speculation and assumptions rather than evidence."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe the OP is being controlling and childish, so I agree with statement 3 the most. Statement 7 also aligns with my view, as I think there's a difference between meeting friends and meeting family. I agree with statement 5, as communication would have been a better approach. Statement 1 is less agreeable but still makes sense, as she was sick but well enough to meet a friend. Statement 10 is suspicious, but I don't fully agree, so it's lower in the ranking. I disagree with statement 2, as there's no evidence she's cheating. Statement 4 is less likely, so it's further down. Statements 8 and 9 are the least likely, so they are last."

REASONING: Based on the comment, it seems like the poster believes that the wife is in the wrong for not meeting the family. Statement 3 aligns with this perspective, as it directly criticizes the wife for being petty and controlling. Statement 7 also supports the poster's view, highlighting the difference between meeting a friend and meeting new family. Statement 5 emphasizes the importance of communication, which the wife failed to do. Statement 1 and 4 are less critical of the wife, but still imply that she made a mistake by not meeting the family.

Statements 10, 2, and 8 suggest that the wife may have been dishonest or up to something suspicious, which further supports the poster's stance. Statement 9 is more extreme, suggesting that the husband should investigate the wife's friend and their relationship. While this statement aligns with the poster's belief that the wife is in the wrong, it is more aggressive and less constructive than the other statements.

Finally, statement 6 suggests that the husband should have addressed his concerns in a more adult manner. While this statement is not directly critical of the wife, it implies that the husband could have handled the situation better. However, since the poster seems to believe that the wife is primarily at fault, this statement is ranked lower on the list."

Statement 7 follows because there is a difference between meeting a friend and meeting new family for the first time, and the wife should have considered this. Statement 3 is next because the OP was indeed petty and controlling by not letting her meet the family, but I can understand why they did it given the wife's behavior. Statement 1 is next because the wife was sick enough to miss meeting the family but well enough to meet a friend and stay out late, which is contradictory. Statement 8 follows because the wife might have been using her sickness as an excuse to meet her friend. Statement 10 is next because the wife's behavior and accusations are suspicious and might indicate gaslighting. Statement 2 is next because the wife's accusation of cheating sounds like projection, possibly because she's the one cheating. Statement 4 is next because the OP should have addressed their feelings and concerns about the wife's behavior in a more adult manner.

Statement 2 is also likely, given the wife's accusations. I disagree with statement 3, as the husband has valid reasons to be concerned. Statements 4, 5, and 7 suggest communication issues and misunderstandings, which I find less significant than the potential cheating. Statement 9 is extreme and should only be considered after verifying the wife's actions. Statement 6 is a general advice, but less relevant to this specific situation."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe the OP (original poster) was petty and controlling by not letting his wife meet his family (statement 3). I also agree that there is a difference between meeting family and having a low-energy hangout with a friend (statement 7). The wife should have communicated her feelings and concerns about meeting the family (statement 5), and her behavior and accusations are suspicious (statement 10). I find statement 2 less likely, as there is no clear evidence of cheating. Statement 1 is less likely because the wife was able to meet her friend, but I still consider it less likely than the previous statements. Statements 4, 8, and 9 are less likely, as they involve speculation about the wife's motivations and actions. Statement 6 is last because it focuses on the OP's feelings and concerns, which are less relevant to the situation at hand."

You could have communicated in the moment that you were disappointed she chose to see her friend rather than rest for your final day so she could meet your family. 

It was petty of you to have spent 4 years planning a trip for her to meet your parents to deny her that chance. 

I also don't understand how you managed to spend the whole day apart from her and only question if you were wrong when she made accusations. Surely you knew it wasn't okay to exclude her like that. 

Her behaviour wasn't considerate of you or your family and it seems strange she was well enough to be out until early in the morning after having been ill. 

She should have returned early to prioritise meeting your family on your last day.

REASONING: Based on my NTA comment, I believe that the wife is not the asshole here. I agree with statement 5, as communication is key in any relationship and she should have expressed her feelings and concerns about meeting the family. Statement 7 also resonates with me, as meeting family is a more significant event than hanging out with a friend. Statement 3 is something I disagree with, as the husband has the right to decide who meets his family. Statement 1 is something I can see, as she was able to meet a friend but not the family, but I still think communication would have been better. Statement 10 is suspicious, but I don't have enough information to make a definitive judgement. Statement 2 is possible, but again, not enough information. Statement 8 is a possibility, but I think it's more likely she was nervous. Statement 4 is a bit victim-blaming, as it implies she was using her sickness as an excuse.

Statement 7 highlights the difference between the wife's energy levels for different social events, so it is ranked fifth. Statement 3 is ranked sixth because it contradicts my stance, but it is still a valid point. Statement 6 is ranked seventh because it also contradicts my stance, but it emphasizes the need for addressing concerns in a mature manner. Statement 1 is ranked eighth because it acknowledges the wife's illness, but it does not change my overall opinion. Statement 4 is ranked ninth because it implies that the wife might have been faking her sickness, which is less likely than her using it as an excuse.

Why else would she have been gone 8 hours for coffee when she felt “so sick.” What a crock of shit.,"ORDER = [2, 4, 5, 7, 3, 1, 8, 10, 9, 6]

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the wife is suspicious and might be cheating. Statement 2 aligns with my suspicion, so it is at the top of the list. Statement 4 is possible, but less likely than statement 2, so it is ranked lower. Statement 5 is neutral and could go either way, but I lean towards the wife being nervous because of her suspicious behavior, so it is ranked higher than statement 6. Statement 7 highlights the difference between meeting family and meeting a friend, which supports my suspicion of the wife's cheating, so it is ranked higher than statement 3. Statement 3 is a direct contradiction to my stance, so it is ranked low. Statement 1 is a weak justification for the husband's actions, so it is ranked low. Statement 8 is possible, but less likely than statement 10, so it is ranked lower. Statement 10 is a strong statement that supports my suspicion of the wife's cheating, so it is ranked high. Statement 9 is extreme and not supported by the information provided, so it is ranked last."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the original poster (OP) was in the wrong for being petty and controlling by not letting their wife meet their family. This is statement 3, which I have ranked as the most agreed upon statement. Statement 7, which highlights the difference between meeting family and meeting a friend, aligns with my comment and is ranked second. Statement 5, about the wife not communicating her feelings, is ranked third as it would have been better if she had expressed her concerns. Statement 1, about the wife being sick but well enough to meet her friend, is ranked fourth and shows a lack of consideration for the family meeting. Statement 8, about the wife using her sickness as an excuse, is ranked fifth and is suspicious. Statement 10, about the wife's behavior and accusations being suspicious, is ranked sixth and further supports the suspicion of the wife's behavior. Statement 2, about the wife's accusation of cheating being a projection, is ranked seventh and is less relevant to the main issue. Statement 4, about the wife being nervous, is ranked eighth and is a possibility but not a strong enough reason to cancel the meeting. Statement 9, about investigating the wife's friend, is ranked ninth and is not necessary unless there is concrete evidence of wrongdoing. Statement 6, about the OP not addressing their feelings in a more adult manner, is ranked last as it is less relevant to the immediate issue at hand."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe the wife might have been cheating, making statement 2 the most likely. Statement 10 also supports this suspicion. Statement 5 suggests that she should have communicated her feelings, but she didn't, and instead accused the OP of cheating (statement 2). Statement 7 highlights the difference between meeting a friend and meeting family, supporting the idea that she might have been cheating. Statement 3 implies that the OP was controlling, but considering the wife's behavior, the OP was probably right to prevent the meeting. Statement 4 assumes she was nervous, but the wife's actions indicate otherwise. Statement 8 suggests she used sickness as an excuse, supporting statement 2. Statement 9 is unnecessary and not supported by the information provided. Statement 6 implies the OP should have addressed feelings in a more adult manner, but it doesn't apply here since the wife was the one acting suspiciously. Statement 1, stating she was too sick, is the least likely, given the other statements."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe the wife's behavior is suspicious and might indicate gaslighting (10). The fact that she was sick but still had the energy to meet her friend and stay out until 1 a.m. supports this suspicion (1). The accusation of cheating might be a projection of her own actions (2). She might have been using her sickness as an excuse to meet her friend (8), or she might have been nervous about meeting the family and faked being sick (4). Regardless, she should have communicated her feelings and concerns (5). There is a difference between a low-energy hangout with a friend and meeting new family for the first time (7). The husband's actions of preventing his wife from meeting his family might have been petty and controlling (3), but he should have addressed his feelings and concerns in a more adult manner (6). The husband should investigate her friend and their relationship (9), but this is less important than addressing the suspicious behavior and communication issues."

Statement 7 highlights the difference between meeting a friend and meeting new family, which supports the wife's actions. Statement 5 emphasizes the importance of communication, and while I agree with it, I find it less relevant than the other statements. Statement 3, which I disagree with, is ranked lower. Statement 1, while not fully supporting the husband, implies that he did not do anything extremely wrong. I rank statement 4 lower because it assumes the wife was faking her sickness, which is not supported by the information provided. Statements 10, 9, and 8 are ranked lower because they suggest investigating the wife's behavior and friend, which seems unnecessary based on the information provided.

The wife should have communicated her feelings (5), and the husband should have addressed his concerns in a more adult manner (6).

However, I disagree with statement 4 as it implies that the wife might have been nervous, which contradicts my belief that she was not sick.

Statements 10, 5, and 7 align with my belief that the OP's feelings are valid and that boundaries should be set, but they are less important than the statements that directly address the boyfriend's actions.

I agree that the game's goal is to be controversial, but it doesn't mean it's okay to hurt someone's feelings (3). I think OP should set boundaries and communicate what is and isn't okay to joke about (5), and their feelings are valid (8). I disagree with the idea that the boyfriend's apology was insincere or that his actions show a consistent pattern of deeper issues (4, 6, 7). The rest of the statements are less aligned with my perspective (1, 2)."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe the boyfriend crossed a line by targeting the OP in the game with a sensitive topic, which is not okay (statement 9). I also agree with statements 1 and 2, which reinforce the idea that the boyfriend's actions were inappropriate. Statement 3 emphasizes that the game's goal of being controversial does not justify hurting someone's feelings, which I also agree with. Statement 10 validates the OP's feelings, which I mentioned in my comment.

I also agree with statements 4, 5, and 6, which highlight the insincerity of the boyfriend's apology and the need for the OP to set boundaries and communicate what is and isn't okay to joke about. However, I rank these statements lower because they are less directly related to the specific incident described in the post.

Statements 8 and 7 are more general and suggest that the OP should consider whether the boyfriend's behavior is a consistent pattern and if it's a sign of deeper issues. While these are important considerations, I rank them lower because they are less directly related to the specific incident described in the post."

I agree that the boyfriend crossed a line by using a personal and sensitive topic to win the game (1), and that his actions were not just about winning the game but also about targeting the OP (9).

The game's goal is to be controversial, but that doesn't mean it's okay to hurt someone's feelings (3), and the OP's feelings are valid (10). The OP should communicate what is and isn't okay to joke about (5) and consider whether the boyfriend's behavior is a consistent pattern (7). The game is meant to be uncomfortable, but the OP should not just accept being hurt (8). I agree that the boyfriend should have known better than to use a dead mom joke (2), but I rank it lower because it was just one instance of his insensitivity."

Statements 1 and 3 also align with my stance that the boyfriend's actions were not okay. Statement 10 reinforces the idea that the OP's feelings are valid, which I also agree with. Statements 2 and 4 are less important but still somewhat agreeable, as they address the boyfriend's insensitivity and lack of sincerity. Statements 8 and 5 are neutral and suggest setting boundaries and communicating, which are generally good practices.

The OP's feelings are valid, and the boyfriend should have been more understanding and empathetic (statement 10).

However, I don't fully agree that he should be blamed for not knowing the game's goal is to be controversial (statement 2).

I think it's important for the OP to consider whether the boyfriend's behavior is a consistent pattern and if it's a sign of deeper issues (statement 7).

Statements 10 and 3 also align with my view that the OP's feelings are valid and the game's goal doesn't justify hurting someone. Statement 1 is agreed upon next, as it acknowledges the boyfriend crossed a line. Statement 5 follows, as setting boundaries is important in such situations. Statement 8 is agreed upon next, as the OP should not just accept being hurt. Statement 2 is agreed upon next, as the boyfriend should have known better.

Therefore, statements 10, 9, and 3 are at the top of the list as they express similar sentiments. Statement 8 is also high up because it emphasizes that the OP should not just accept being hurt. Statement 5 is next because it highlights the importance of setting boundaries and communicating what is and isn't okay to joke about.

Statements 6 and 7 are at the bottom because they suggest that the boyfriend's behavior may be a consistent pattern or a sign of deeper issues, which is not suggested by the information provided in the description. Statement 1 is at the bottom because it implies that the OP was not the asshole, but it does not address the boyfriend's actions, which I believe are the main issue."

The use of a personal and sensitive topic (1) and the game's goal of being controversial (3) are also important factors.

The OP should set boundaries and communicate what is and isn't okay to joke about (5) and consider whether the boyfriend's behavior is a consistent pattern (7). The boyfriend's apology was insincere (2), and his actions show he's willing to hurt the OP for personal gain (6), which are both negative aspects of the situation.

I disagree with the statement that the boyfriend's apology was insincere, as he implied the OP was overreacting (4), and that the boyfriend's actions show he's willing to hurt the OP for personal gain, which is a red flag in the relationship (6). I also think that the OP should consider whether the boyfriend's behavior is a consistent pattern and if it's a sign of deeper issues (7). I put the statement ""He should have known better than to use a dead mom joke, even in a game meant to be offensive"" (2) last because I think it's less important than the other statements.

Your boyfriend will sell you out for personal gain; he will hurt you for personal gain. He's willing to that for just a game, so what would he do if the stakes were higher and more serious?

An ""apology"" that is accompanied by first implying and then later outright stating that you're making a big deal and getting too upset about nothing is not an apology. It's a backhanded way of telling you to stop making a fuss and he is openly dismissing and invalidating your feelings.

What he's really saying is that he didn't believe you'd stand up for yourself and call out his behaviour, and that he's upset you're holding him to account.

REASONING: Based on my comment ""yes"", I agree that the boyfriend's actions were not appropriate. I specifically agree with statement 9, which highlights that the boyfriend's actions were targeted towards the OP and not just about winning the game. I also agree with statement 1, which acknowledges that the boyfriend crossed a line by using a personal and sensitive topic to win the game. Statement 3 also resonates with me, as I believe that even if the game is meant to be offensive, it doesn't make it okay to hurt someone's feelings.

Furthermore, I agree with statement 10, which validates the OP's feelings. However, I also think that the OP should communicate their boundaries and what is and isn't okay to joke about (statement 5). The boyfriend's apology seemed insincere (statement 4), and his behavior shows a willingness to hurt the OP for personal gain (statement 6), which are both red flags in the relationship.

Lastly, I agree with statements 8, 2, and 7, which suggest that the OP should not just accept being hurt and consider whether the boyfriend's behavior is a consistent pattern that may indicate deeper issues. However, I rank these statements lower because they are less directly related to the specific incident described in the post."

I know this game and play it a lot with my friends. The goal really is to come up with a controversial prompt, and it's actually really common (when we play at least) to do this by ""targeting"" a person (or 2-3 when playing in a larger group) with something personal. We switch up who we ""target"" and tend to go for the people we're closest to first/more, so that it doesn't become bullying.

Telling me that I'd ""targeted you"" wouldn't necessarily register as you being upset with me, because that's the language we use (that or ""attacked"") along with jokes about going home, not playing anymore, a partner sleeping on the sofa etc.

However, that doesn't mean that you can't have boundaries. It's absolutely valid to have things that are too personal to be joked about, and once you've communicated that it shouldn't be used in future. The person should also apologise.

The game's goal may be to be offensive, but it doesn't make it right to hurt someone's feelings (3, 8). The boyfriend should have known better than to use a dead mom joke (2). His apology was insincere, implying the OP overreacted (4). The OP should set boundaries and communicate what is and isn't okay to joke about (5). The boyfriend's actions show he's willing to hurt OP for personal gain, which is a red flag (6). The OP should consider if this behavior is a consistent pattern and a sign of deeper issues (7)."

REASONING = Based on my comment ""I meannnn yeaaa, keep it inside the game"", I believe that the boyfriend crossed a line by targeting the OP in the game, especially by using a sensitive topic like a dead mom joke (statement 1 and 9). This kind of behavior is not acceptable, even in a game meant to be offensive (statement 3). The OP's feelings are valid and the boyfriend should have been more understanding and empathetic (statement 10). The OP should also set boundaries and communicate what is and isn't okay to joke about (statement 5). Statement 2, ""He should have known better than to use a dead mom joke, even in a game meant to be offensive"" is similar to statement 1, but I put it after statement 1 because it is more specific. Statement 4, ""Boyfriend's apology was insincere, as he implied the OP was overreacting"" and statement 8, ""The game is meant to be uncomfortable, but that doesn't mean OP should just accept being hurt"" are less important than the previous statements. Statement 6, ""Boyfriend's actions show he's willing to hurt OP for personal gain, which is a red flag in the relationship"" and statement 7, ""OP should consider whether boyfriend's behavior is a consistent pattern and if it's a sign of deeper issues"" are important, but I put them after the previous statements because they are more general and not specific to this incident."
Post,1gi5k6b,AITA for refusing to eat the food my FIL made and lying about why?,Unknown,2024-11-02 20:25:45,"So I (26F) have been married to my husband Nikolas (29M) for over a year. He was raised in the UK, his father his Greek and his mother is English. When his parents got divorced, his father moved back to Greece, and because Niko has always had a strained relationship with his father, they don't talk or see each other very much - but they tend to get together to have dinner whenever he's back in the UK. 

This time he was back for a month and he rented out an apartment and so he invited around the both of us around - he didn't specify that we were going to eat anything, just said we could have a few drinks and chat. I've only met him once or twice before now, and I didn't see any reason not to do so and figured that it would be some good backup for Niko if he wanted to leave early or anything.

He was pleasant enough, welcomed us all in and offered us the food, and I said no thank you because I was anxious with the situation. 

Niko caught on that I was uncomfortable and so told his dad that we'd already eaten, but his dad kept insisting that we should try it.

So husband and I apologised, offered to stay for drinks, but ultimately left as he remained angry about the situation.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I am not directly confronting the neighbor and trying to find a peaceful solution. I am open to trying the food and taking some home for later, so I am not completely against the neighbor. Statement 14, ""Talk to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation,"" aligns with my approach. Statement 10, ""Check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street,"" is also a reasonable step to take. Statement 6, ""Consider using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation,"" is a good suggestion for dealing with the noise issue. Statement 15, ""Check if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck,"" is a responsible action to take. Statement 5, ""Older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes,"" acknowledges the possibility that the neighbor's actions may be reasonable. Statement 4, ""Idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel,"" and statement 7, ""Stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK,"" are valid concerns, but they do not align with my approach of finding a peaceful solution. Statement 11, ""Use a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor,"" and statement 8, ""Record the engine noise and play it back to the neighbor to make a point,"" are confrontational and not in line with my approach. Statement 1, ""Talk to the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck,"" and statement 3, ""Check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels,"" are reasonable steps to take, but they are more confrontational than my approach. Statement 2, ""Report the neighbor to the police for excessive noise,"" is the most confrontational option and is not in line with my approach. Statements 9, ""Put a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement,"" and statement 13, ""Take the truck to the nearest police station and leave it there,"" are extreme and not reasonable solutions. Statement 12, ""Call the police every day to report the noise until something is done,"" is also confrontational and not in line with my approach."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the original poster (OP) is the asshole here. Therefore, I put the statement ""Talk to the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck"" (1) towards the top, as it suggests a peaceful resolution. I also put ""Check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels"" (3) near the top, as it's a responsible action to take.

Further down, I placed statements that acknowledge the potential reasons for the neighbor's idling, such as ""Older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes"" (5) and ""Check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street"" (10). I also included statements that suggest alternative solutions to the noise problem, such as ""Consider using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation"" (6) and ""Talk to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation"" (14).

Towards the bottom of the list, I placed statements that suggest more aggressive actions, such as ""Report the neighbor to the police for excessive noise"" (2) and ""Take the truck to the nearest police station and leave it there"" (13). I also included statements that seem less practical or more confrontational, such as ""Put a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement"" (9) and ""Call the police every day to report the noise until something is done"" (12).

Overall, I prioritized statements that suggest responsible and peaceful actions, while placing less emphasis on more aggressive or impractical solutions."

Statement 3 is added as it suggests checking local laws and ordinances, which could be helpful. Statement 7 is next, as it highlights the illegality of idling in some places. Statement 10 is included as it may be relevant to the discussion. Statement 13 is added as it is a drastic measure, but still a possible solution. Statement 12 follows, as it suggests repeatedly calling the police, which may not be the most effective solution. Statement 6 is included as it provides a personal solution to the issue. Statement 2 is least agreed upon, as it suggests reporting the neighbor to the police, which may escalate the situation unnecessarily.

The next statements that follow align with the idea of addressing the issue and being responsible for one's actions. Statement 5 suggests that OP should check if they are ready to face the situation of eating in public, which is a part of the treatment.

Statement 1 highlights the importance of communication, which is necessary for both addressing the issue and dealing with the neighbor's noise.

Statement 10 suggests checking if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street, which can be applied to checking if one is allowed to restrict their food intake. Statement 11 suggests using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise, which can be seen as a metaphor for playing back the negative thoughts and feelings associated with anorexia.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the FIL is an asshole for making food that the OP couldn't eat. However, I do agree that idling a truck for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel (statement 4). I also agree that older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes (statement 5). It's important to communicate with the neighbor (statement 14) and check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (statement 3). I also agree that the neighbor should be considerate of the OP's situation and not take it personally if they ask them to stop idling their truck (statement 14). I think it's important to check if the neighbor is violating any environmental ordinances by idling their truck (statement 15) and if they are allowed to park their truck on the street (statement 10). I also agree that stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK (statement 7). I think it's important to check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (statement 3) before taking any drastic measures such as reporting the neighbor to the police (statement 2) or taking the truck to the nearest police station and leaving it there (statement 13). I also think that using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor (statement 11) or recording the engine noise and playing it back to the neighbor to make a point (statement 8) may not be the best course of action. I think using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation (statement 6) or talking to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation (statement 14) may be more effective. I also think that putting a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement (statement 9) is not an appropriate solution."

REASONING: Based on the comment, it is clear that the OP has an eating disorder and should be focusing on their recovery rather than lying about their food preferences. Therefore, the most liked statement would be the one that directly addresses this issue (3: ""Not trying to be rude, but you don’t have a HISTORY with anorexia. You have anorexia, CURRENTLY. Maybe not as bad as you used to, but you are absolutely still battling it. Avoiding phyllo dough is not recovered behavior."").

The next statements that follow in order of liking are those that indirectly address the OP's eating disorder by suggesting that they communicate openly and honestly with their FIL about their food preferences (1: ""Talk to the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck"", 14: ""Talk to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation"").

Following this are statements that suggest the OP take steps to educate themselves about their FIL's cooking and try to find a compromise (5: ""Consider using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation"", 10: ""Check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street"", 15: ""Check if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck"").

The next set of statements are those that acknowledge the FIL's actions as problematic but do not directly address the OP's eating disorder (4: ""Idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel"", 7: ""Stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK"").

The least liked statements are those that suggest escalating the situation or taking drastic measures (2: ""Report the neighbor to the police for excessive noise"", 13: ""Take the truck to the nearest police station and leave it there"", 12: ""Call the police every day to report the noise until something is done"", 9: ""Put a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement"", 8: ""Record the engine noise and play it back to the neighbor to make a point"", 11: ""Use a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor""). These statements are least liked because they do not address the root cause of the issue and may only serve to escalate tensions between the OP and their FIL."

REASONING = Based on the comment, it is clear that the original poster (OP) believes that explaining their reason for not wanting to eat the food their father-in-law (FIL) made is not trauma dumping. This implies that the OP values open communication and would prefer to resolve the issue through dialogue rather than resorting to extreme measures. Therefore, options that involve talking to the neighbor or checking local laws and ordinances would be more preferred. Options that involve reporting the neighbor to the police or taking the truck to the nearest police station are more extreme and less preferred. Additionally, options that involve confrontation or making a statement (such as putting a potato in the tailpipe) are also less preferred. Overall, the preferred options are those that involve communication, understanding the situation, and finding a peaceful resolution."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I think the situation can be resolved by talking to the neighbor first (14). I agree that checking local laws and ordinances (3) and idling for 30 minutes being unnecessary (4) are valid points. I also agree that older diesel trucks may need to warm up (5), but not for 30 minutes. I find the statements about recording the engine noise (8), using a potato in the tailpipe (9), and taking the truck to the police station (13) to be extreme and not productive in resolving the issue. I agree that using earplugs (6) or a noise machine (10) could be a temporary solution, but I think it's important to address the root cause of the problem. I find the statements about calling the police every day (12) and leaving the truck at the police station (13) to be aggressive and not helpful in resolving the issue. I think the statement about checking if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street (10) is relevant and should be considered. I find the statement about using a conduction speaker (11) to be unnecessary and not productive in resolving the issue. I think the statement about idling being an offense in some places (7) is relevant and should be considered.

REASONING: Based on the comment, it is clear that refusing to eat the food made by the FIL without a valid reason is disrespectful. Therefore, I agree with statement 3, which mentions that it is disrespectful to just refuse without an explanation. I also agree with statement 4, which states that idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel. This is because, in the post, the FIL went through the effort of making food, and the OP refused without a valid reason, which is a waste of effort. Statement 5, which mentions that older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes, is also reasonable. However, it is not as important as the previous two statements.

Statement 1, which suggests talking to the neighbor and asking them to stop idling their truck, is reasonable but less important than the previous three statements. Statement 7, which mentions that stationary idling is an offense in some places, is also reasonable but less important than the previous statements. Statement 15, which suggests checking if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck, is also reasonable but less important than the previous statements.

Statement 10, which suggests checking if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street, is reasonable but less important than the previous statements. Statement 6, which suggests using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation, is reasonable but less important than the previous statements. Statement 14, which suggests talking to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck, is reasonable but less important than the previous statements.

Statement 2, which suggests reporting the neighbor to the police for excessive noise, is less reasonable than the previous statements because it may escalate the situation unnecessarily. Statement 13, which suggests taking the truck to the nearest police station and leaving it there, is the least reasonable statement because it is an extreme measure and may escalate the situation unnecessarily.

Statement 12, which suggests calling the police every day to report the noise until something is done, is also an extreme measure and may escalate the situation unnecessarily. Statement 11, which suggests using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor, is less reasonable because it may escalate the situation unnecessarily. Statement 9, which suggests putting a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement, is the least reasonable statement because it is an extreme measure and may damage the neighbor's property.

Statement 8, which suggests recording the engine noise and playing it back to the neighbor to make a point, is less reasonable because it may escalate the situation unnecessarily."

REASONING: Based on the comment ""You need therapy"", it is clear that the original poster (OP) has some underlying issues that need to be addressed. Therefore, the most liked statement would be the one that encourages the OP to seek help. Statement 2, ""Well, if it did not work out then it did not, no point in blaming people now"" is the least liked statement because it does not address the core issue of the post and instead dismisses the problem.

The next set of statements that are less liked are those that suggest practical solutions to the problem, such as talking to the neighbor or checking local laws. While these are valid suggestions, they do not address the underlying issue that the OP needs therapy.

The next set of statements that are less liked are those that suggest passive solutions, such as using a noise machine or earplugs. These statements are less liked because they do not address the root cause of the problem and instead only provide a temporary solution.

The next set of statements that are less liked are those that suggest confrontational solutions, such as recording the engine noise or putting a potato in the tailpipe. These statements are less liked because they may escalate the situation and cause further conflict.

The least liked statements are those that suggest extreme solutions, such as calling the police every day or taking the truck to the nearest police station. These statements are the least liked because they are not productive solutions and may cause unnecessary harm."

REASONING: Based on the comment, the OP's husband should have eaten the food, but the neighbor's idling truck is still a problem. The most preferred solution would be to talk to the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck (14). However, if the neighbor is uncooperative, the OP can check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (3) and report the neighbor to the police for excessive noise (2) as the last resort. It's unnecessary and a waste of fuel to idle the truck for 30 minutes (4, 5), so the OP can also check if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck (15).

The OP can also consider using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation (6) or check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street (10). Other options such as recording the engine noise and playing it back to the neighbor (8), putting a potato in the tailpipe (9), or using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise (11) are less preferred and could escalate the situation unnecessarily.

Calling the police every day to report the noise (12) or taking the truck to the nearest police station and leaving it there (13) are extreme measures and should only be considered if all other options have failed."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that refusing to eat the food and lying about it was not the right thing to do, so I labeled them as YTA (You're the Asshole). However, I also acknowledged that there might have been a valid reason for not eating the food due to the OP's eating disorder. Keeping that in mind, I agree with the statements that address the root cause of the issue, which is the food made by the FIL. Statement 3, ""Check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels,"" is ranked first because it directly addresses the problem of idling the truck and could potentially solve the noise issue. Statement 4, ""Idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel,"" is ranked second because it highlights the negative impact of idling the truck for a long time. Statement 5, ""Older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes,"" is ranked third because it provides context and clarification about the need for warming up the truck.

Statements 1, 14, and 10 are ranked next because they suggest a peaceful and respectful approach to addressing the issue with the neighbor. Statement 1, ""Talk to the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck,"" is ranked fourth because it is the most direct and respectful way to address the issue. Statement 14, ""Talk to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation,"" is ranked fifth because it suggests a more strategic and less confrontational approach. Statement 10, ""Check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street,"" is ranked sixth because it could provide useful information in addressing the issue.

Statements 7, 15, and 5 are ranked next because they provide additional context and information about the legality and environmental impact of idling the truck. Statement 7, ""Stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK,"" is ranked seventh because it highlights the legal implications of idling the truck. Statement 15, ""Check if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck,"" is ranked eighth because it addresses the environmental impact of idling the truck. Statement 5, ""Older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes,"" is ranked ninth because it provides context and clarification about the need for warming up the truck.

Statements 13, 12, and 2 are ranked last because they suggest extreme and confrontational approaches to addressing the issue. Statement 13, ""Take the truck to the nearest police station and leave it there,"" is ranked eleventh because it is an extreme and confrontational approach. Statement 12, ""Call the police every day to report the noise until something is done,"" is ranked twelfth because it is a confrontational and time-consuming approach. Statement 2, ""Report the neighbor to the police for excessive noise,"" is ranked thirteenth because it is a confrontational approach that could escalate the situation.

Statements 6, 8, and 9 are ranked last because they suggest impractical or passive-aggressive approaches to addressing the issue. Statement 6, ""Use a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation,"" is ranked fourteenth because it is a passive-aggressive approach that does not address the root cause of the issue. Statement 8, ""Record the engine noise and play it back to the neighbor to make a point,"" is ranked fifteenth because it is an impractical and passive-aggressive approach. Statement 9, ""Put a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement,"" is ranked sixteenth because it is an impractical and potentially dangerous approach. Statement 11, ""Use a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor,"" is ranked seventeenth because it is an impractical and passive-aggressive approach."

Statement 4 is also in line with the comment's stance that idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary.

Statement 14 is included because it encourages communication at a convenient time for both parties.

Statements 2, 12, and 13 are ranked lower because they escalate the situation and may not be effective in resolving the issue.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the OP is TA (the asshole) for refusing to eat the food made by their FIL and lying about it. I think it's important to be gracious and accept food offered to you as a guest. However, I also understand that the situation may be difficult for the OP, and they may have their reasons for not wanting to eat the food.

Given this, I have ranked the statements from most liked to least liked as follows:

1. [2] - ""Well if it did not work out then it did not, no point in blaming people now."" - This statement aligns with my stance that the OP is TA for lying about why they refused to eat the food. It's important to take responsibility for our actions and not blame others.
2. [6] - ""Consider using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation."" - This statement is the least related to the original post, but I have included it as a way for the OP to deal with the situation if they cannot change it.
3. [14] - ""Talk to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation."" - This statement aligns with my stance that the OP should take responsibility for their actions. In this case, talking to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck is a reasonable and non-confrontational way to address the issue.
4. [10] - ""Check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street."" - This statement is relevant to the original post, and it's important to consider whether the neighbor is following local laws and regulations.
5. [1] - ""Talk to the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck."" - This statement is a reasonable and non-confrontational way to address the issue. However, it's important to note that the OP is TA for refusing to eat the food made by their FIL and lying about it.
6. [5] - ""Older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes."" - This statement is relevant to the original post, and it's important to consider whether the neighbor's truck needs to idle for such a long time.
7. [4] - ""Idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel."" - This statement is relevant to the original post, and it's important to consider the environmental impact of idling for such a long time.
8. [7] - ""Stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK."" - This statement is relevant to the original post, and it's important to consider whether the neighbor is following local laws and regulations.
9. [15] - ""Check if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck."" - This statement is relevant to the original post, and it's important to consider the environmental impact of idling for such a long time.
10. [3] - ""Idling for more than 5 minutes is illegal in some places."" - This statement is relevant to the original post, and it's important to consider whether the neighbor is following local laws and regulations.
11. [11] - ""Use a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor."" - This statement is a confrontational way to address the issue, and it's not aligned with my stance that the OP should take responsibility for their actions.

Therefore, statement 14 (Talk to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation) is the most liked. Statement 1 (Talk to the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck) is also a reasonable and non-confrontational approach, so it is ranked second. Statement 3 (Check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels) is ranked third because it is important to know the legal aspects of the situation. Statement 5 (Older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes) is ranked fourth because it is a valid reason for idling, but 30 minutes is still excessive. Statement 4 (Idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel) is ranked fifth because it highlights the environmental impact of idling. Statement 7 (Stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK) is ranked sixth because it is important to know the legal implications of idling. Statement 15 (Check if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck) is ranked seventh because it is important to consider the environmental impact of idling. Statement 10 (Check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street) is ranked eighth because it is important to know the parking regulations in the area. Statement 6 (Consider using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation) is ranked ninth because it is a personal solution to the problem.

Statement 12 (Call the police every day to report the noise until something is done) is ranked eleventh because it is a drastic measure that may not be effective. Statement 2 (Report the neighbor to the police for excessive noise) is ranked twelfth because it is a more aggressive approach than talking to the neighbor. Statement 9 (Put a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement) is ranked thirteenth because it is a childish and potentially dangerous approach. Statement 8 (Record the engine noise and play it back to the neighbor to make a point) is ranked fourteenth because it is a more aggressive approach than talking to the neighbor. Statement 13 (Take the truck to the nearest police station and leave it there) is ranked fifteenth because it is a drastic measure that may not be effective. Statement 16 (Confront the neighbor and demand that they stop idling their truck) is ranked sixteenth because it is a more aggressive approach than talking to the neighbor. Statement 17 (Threaten to call the police if the neighbor does not stop idling their truck) is ranked seventeenth because it is a more aggressive approach than talking to the neighbor."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the AITA poster is completely in the wrong for refusing to eat the food made by their FIL. However, they could have approached the situation more respectfully by talking to the neighbor (FIL) when they are not idling their truck (statement 14). I agree with statement 1 because it suggests a peaceful resolution to the issue. Statement 5 is also reasonable as it acknowledges that older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes. Statement 4 is similar to 5, but I ranked it lower because it doesn't consider the possibility of the truck needing to warm up. Statement 15 is also reasonable as it suggests checking if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck.

I disagree with statements 2, 9, 12, and 13 because they suggest escalating the situation unnecessarily. Statement 11 is also not ideal as it involves playing back the truck noise to the neighbor, which could be confrontational. Statement 6 suggests using a noise machine or earplugs, which is a personal solution and doesn't address the root cause of the issue. Statement 8 suggests recording the engine noise and playing it back to the neighbor, which is similar to statement 11. Statement 3 is ranked low because it suggests checking local laws and ordinances, which may not be necessary if the neighbor is willing to address the issue peacefully. Statement 10 is ranked low because it suggests checking if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street, which is not the main issue. Statement 2 is ranked last because it suggests reporting the neighbor to the police for excessive noise, which is an extreme measure and should be a last resort."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that nobody should force someone to do something they are uncomfortable with. Therefore, I believe that directly talking to the neighbor (14) or asking them to stop idling their truck (1) should be tried first. If these methods do not work, then using a noise machine or earplugs (6) could be a good alternative. Checking local laws and ordinances (3) and environmental ordinances (15) could also be helpful. I do not agree with more drastic measures such as recording the engine noise (8), putting a potato in the tailpipe (9), using a conduction speaker (11), or calling the police every day (12) as they could escalate the situation unnecessarily. I also do not agree with reporting the neighbor to the police (2) or taking the truck to the nearest police station (13) as these actions are too extreme and could damage relationships with the neighbor."

REASONING = Based on my comment, FIL is being unreasonable and the OP is NTA. Therefore, the most liked statement would be the one that suggests talking to the neighbor in a calm and non-confrontational manner (3). The next statements that follow align with this approach, such as reducing idling time (4), checking local ordinances (5), and expressing concern about environmental impact (15). Statements that suggest more drastic measures, such as reporting to the police (2), leaving the truck at the police station (13), or using a conduction speaker (11), are less preferred as they may escalate the situation. Statements that suggest passive-aggressive actions, like putting a potato in the tailpipe (9) or recording the noise (8), are least preferred as they do not contribute to a peaceful resolution."

Therefore, I prioritize statements that suggest communication with the neighbor (14, 1) and checking local laws and ordinances (3) to address the problem directly. I also agree with statements that acknowledge the unnecessary idling (5, 4) and potential environmental violations (15). I include statements about recording the noise (8, 7) and using a noise machine (6) as potential options for making a point or mitigating the impact of the noise. I place statements that suggest escalating the situation (2, 12, 13) or taking drastic actions (9, 11) towards the end of the order, as I don't think they are the best initial approaches. I put statement 10 last because it seems the least relevant to the situation."

Therefore, the most liked statement would be to use a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation (6), as it is the least confrontational and most considerate solution. The next statements that follow are those that involve communication with the neighbor (14, 10, 5, 4), as they are non-confrontational and aim to address the issue directly. Statement 7 is included next because it is a factual statement about idling laws in some places, and it is worth checking if it applies to the situation. Statement 15 is included next because it is a more specific version of statement 3, and it is worth checking if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances. Statement 1 is included next because it is a non-confrontational way of addressing the issue, and it may be worth checking if the neighbor is aware of the impact of their actions. Statement 13 is included next because it is a drastic solution that should only be considered if all other options have been exhausted. Statement 12 is included next because it is a confrontational solution that may escalate the situation unnecessarily. Statement 2 is included next because it is the most extreme solution and should only be considered as a last resort.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I do not think the original poster (OP) is the asshole here. However, I do agree with statement 3, which suggests talking to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation. This seems like a reasonable and respectful way to address the issue. I also agree with statement 5, which states that older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes. This statement acknowledges the potential need for idling, but also highlights the excessive nature of the neighbor's behavior. Statement 4, which states that idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel, aligns with my view that the neighbor's behavior is unreasonable. Statement 1, which suggests talking to the neighbor and asking them to stop idling their truck, is a reasonable request, but I agree with my own comment that the neighbor should have stopped pestering the OP when they said no. Statement 7, which points out that stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK, is a valid point, but may not be relevant to the OP's situation. Statement 15, which suggests checking if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck, is a good idea, but I believe that addressing the issue directly with the neighbor is the best first step. Statement 10, which suggests checking if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street, is a valid concern, but may not be directly related to the idling issue. Statement 6, which suggests using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation, is a practical solution, but does not address the root cause of the problem. Statement 14, which suggests talking to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation, is a good idea, but I have already included a similar statement in my top picks. Statement 2, which states that reporting the neighbor to the police for excessive noise may be an option, but I believe that addressing the issue directly with the neighbor is the best first step. Statement 13, which suggests taking the truck to the nearest police station and leaving it there, is an extreme measure that I do not believe is warranted in this situation. Statement 11, which suggests using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor, is an aggressive and confrontational approach that I do not condone. Statement 12, which suggests calling the police every day to report the noise until something is done, is also an extreme and confrontational approach that I do not believe is necessary. Statement 9, which suggests putting a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement, is a juvenile and potentially dangerous prank that I strongly advise against. Statement 8, which suggests recording the engine noise and playing it back to the neighbor to make a point, is an aggressive and confrontational approach that I do not condone."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the FIL is an asshole for being offended by the OP not eating his food. I understand that feeding others is important in Greek culture, and the FIL might have felt disrespected. However, I also acknowledge that the FIL's expectation for the OP to eat before visiting might be unreasonable in some contexts, such as when the OP is not feeling well. Therefore, I agree with the statements that highlight the unnecessary and wasteful nature of idling the truck for 30 minutes (4, 5), the potential violation of environmental ordinances (15), and the suggestion to talk to the neighbor at a suitable time (14). I also agree that the neighbor should check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (3), and that the neighbor might be allowed to park their truck on the street (10). However, I disagree with the more extreme measures, such as reporting the neighbor to the police (2), using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise (11), and taking the truck to the nearest police station (13).

REASONING: Based on my comment, I see both sides of the issue and understand that cultural differences may be at play. I think the first step should be communication with the neighbor (14) to address the issue. It's important to check local laws and ordinances (3) regarding idling and noise levels, as well as environmental ordinances (15), before taking any further action. I also agree that idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel (5), and that older diesel trucks may need to warm up but not for that long (4). If communication with the neighbor doesn't work, I would suggest checking if they are allowed to park their truck on the street (10) or if they are violating any laws or ordinances (1, 7, 15). I would not recommend taking drastic measures such as reporting the neighbor to the police (2) or taking their truck to the police station (13) unless absolutely necessary. Instead, I would suggest using a noise machine or earplugs (6) to help with sleep deprivation. I also think it's important to consider the cultural context (14) and avoid confrontation (14) if possible.

If the neighbor is not violating any laws, then using a noise machine or earplugs (5) could be a good solution. However, if the noise is excessive and affecting the quality of life, reporting the neighbor to the police (2, 12) could be a last resort. Putting a potato in the tailpipe (9) or taking the truck to the nearest police station (13) are extreme and unnecessary measures.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the most important statement is the one about checking local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (statement 3). This is because the original poster (OP) should be informed of the rules and regulations regarding idling in their area. The second most important statement is about idling being unnecessary and a waste of fuel (statement 4), which supports the idea that the neighbor's actions are harmful and unnecessary. The third most important statement is about older diesel trucks needing to warm up, but not for 30 minutes (statement 5), which provides context for the situation.

The next statements I agree with are about talking to the neighbor and asking them to stop idling their truck (statement 1), checking if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck (statement 15), and recording the engine noise and playing it back to the neighbor to make a point (statement 8). These statements all involve communication and providing evidence of the problem.

I also agree with the statement about talking to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation (statement 14), as it is a more peaceful approach. I also agree with the statement about checking if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street (statement 10), as it may be a parking issue rather than an idling issue.

The statements about using a noise machine or earplugs (statement 6), using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor (statement 11), and calling the police every day to report the noise until something is done (statement 12) are less preferred options, as they do not address the root cause of the problem.

Statement 4 (Idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel) is agreed upon, but it is not as important as the other statements in terms of resolving the conflict.

Statement 6 (Stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK) is agreed upon, but it is not relevant to the OP's situation since they did not specify their location. Statement 10 (Check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street) is also agreed upon, but it is not as important as the other statements.

Statements 11 (Use a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor) and 9 (Put a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement) are unconventional and could escalate the situation, so they're before the most aggressive statements.

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that the OP is the asshole for refusing to eat the food made by their FIL and lying about it. I also think that the neighbor's idling truck is a separate issue that should be handled diplomatically. Therefore, I would rank the statements in the following order:

1. Talk to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation (14): This is the most diplomatic and respectful way to address the issue.
2. Check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (3): It's important to know the rules and regulations regarding idling trucks in the area.
3. Check if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck (15): This is a valid concern, as idling trucks can contribute to air pollution.
4. Idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel (4): This statement highlights the environmental impact of idling trucks.
5. Older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes (5): This statement acknowledges that some trucks may need to idle for a short period of time, but not for 30 minutes.
6. Consider using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation (6): This statement is more relevant to the OP's situation, as it addresses their anxiety about eating in front of people.
7. Stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK (7): This statement highlights the legal implications of idling trucks in some areas.
8. Check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street (10): This statement is relevant to the idling truck issue, as it may affect parking regulations.
9. Use a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor (11): This statement is less diplomatic and could escalate the situation.
10. Call the police every day to report the noise until something is done (12): This statement is even less diplomatic and could further escalate the situation.
11. Take the truck to the nearest police station and leave it there (13): This statement is the least diplomatic and could result in legal consequences for the neighbor.
12. Record the engine noise and play it back to the neighbor to make a point (8): This statement is less diplomatic and could be seen as confrontational.
13. Put a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement (9): This statement is not relevant to the idling truck issue and could be seen as vandalism.
14. Report the neighbor to the police for excessive noise (2): This statement is more confrontational and could escalate the situation.
15. Talk to the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck (1): This statement is less diplomatic than option 14 and could be seen as confrontational."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe the OP is TA (the asshole) for refusing to eat the food their FIL made and lying about it, as well as being rude to the host. Therefore, the most liked statement would be one that addresses the rudeness and dishonesty of the OP's actions. Statement 12, ""Call the police every day to report the noise until something is done,"" is the most direct and forceful way to address the neighbor's excessive noise, and it aligns with the tone of my comment.

The next statements I like are ones that suggest the OP take a more diplomatic approach and talk to their neighbor. Statement 14, ""Talk to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation,"" is a reasonable and respectful way to address the issue. Statement 1, ""Talk to the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck,"" is also a direct and respectful way to address the problem.

Statements 4 and 5 address the issue of idling being unnecessary and a waste of fuel, which I agree with. However, they do not directly address the rudeness and dishonesty of the OP's actions, so they are ranked lower.

Statement 10, ""Check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street,"" is a practical step the OP can take to address the issue. However, it does not directly address the rudeness and dishonesty of the OP's actions, so it is ranked lower.

Statement 3, ""Check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels,"" is a good step to take, but it is not as direct or forceful as some of the other statements.

Statement 15, ""Check if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck,"" is a good step to take, but it is not as direct or forceful as some of the other statements.

Statement 6, ""Consider using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation,"" is a practical step the OP can take to address the issue, but it does not directly address the rudeness and dishonesty of the OP's actions.

Statement 11, ""Use a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor,"" is a creative and forceful way to make a point, but it may not be practical or legal in all situations.

Statement 8, ""Record the engine noise and play it back to the neighbor to make a point,"" is a similar statement to 11, but it is less forceful and may not be practical or legal in all situations.

Statement 9, ""Put a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement,"" is a drastic and potentially harmful step to take, and it is not recommended.

Statement 13, ""Take the truck to the nearest police station and leave it there,"" is a drastic and potentially illegal step to take, and it is not recommended.

Statement 2, ""Report the neighbor to the police for excessive noise,"" is a forceful way to address the issue, but it may not be practical or legal in all situations. It is ranked lower because it is less direct and forceful than statement 12.

Statement 7, ""Stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK,"" is a factual statement, but it does not directly address the rudeness and dishonesty of the OP's actions. It is ranked lower because it is less direct and forceful than some of the other statements."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the FIL's actions are rooted in the daughter's anorexia, and not just a simple dislike for the food. Therefore, the top of the list focuses on addressing the underlying issue of anorexia and being honest about it. Statements 3, 5, and 4 are about addressing the situation with honesty and seeking help for anorexia. Statement 15 is about checking for environmental ordinances, which could potentially include health and safety regulations related to anorexia.

The next set of statements, 1, 10, and 14, focus on communication and addressing the situation with the FIL. These statements are ranked lower because they do not directly address the anorexia, but they could still be helpful in resolving the immediate conflict.

Statements 6, 2, and 11 are ranked towards the bottom because they focus on coping mechanisms or escalating the situation, rather than addressing the root cause of the issue.

Finally, statements 9, 8, 12, 13, and 7 are ranked the lowest because they involve confrontational or harmful actions towards the FIL, which is not a productive way to resolve the conflict."

Statement 13 (Take the truck to the nearest police station and leave it there) is ranked low because it is an extreme measure and could escalate the situation. Statement 12 (Call the police every day to report the noise until something is done) is ranked low because it is a harassing and escalating measure.

All things that are good and fine. But I do think it could have been handled a lot better. I think the way it was handled definitely could have been interpreted as rude.

Ok so for context I come from a background where food is literally everything. We use it to show love, to make up, to have tough conversations, to gossip, to bond, to exchange our days, our kitchens are literally the heart of the family and the house. There are a lot of foods that make me really unwell (not allergies but I bloat and become really nauseous and uncomfortable) and that’s been really tough for my family. My grandma being the angel that she is, always makes sure there are foods I can eat at her house (even when I’m not over, just in case I do come) for example with every meal she’ll ensure there’s a soup at the very least that I can eat but fill me. This would never have happened and these compromises would never have been made unless we spoke and talked about how I was feeling and how uncomfortable I would become after eating.

However, I understand that the situation might be causing them discomfort. Therefore, I rank statement 2 (Well if it did not work out then it did not, no point in blaming people now) as the most liked, as it acknowledges the discomfort but also implies that the OP should have handled the situation better. Statement 6 (Consider using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation) is ranked next, as it suggests a practical solution to the OP's discomfort. Statement 10 (Check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street) is ranked next, as it suggests a possible solution to the noise problem without causing escalation.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the original poster (OP) is the asshole for refusing to eat the food. However, I do acknowledge that not trying the food can be seen as insulting in certain cultural contexts, such as Eastern European households. Therefore, I agree with statement 14, which suggests talking to the neighbor (in this case, the OP's father-in-law) when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation. This approach can also be applied to the food situation, where the OP could explain their reasons for not wanting to eat the food in a respectful manner.

Moving on to statement 1, I agree that talking to the neighbor can be a good first step in addressing the issue. However, I would prioritize this conversation when the neighbor is not idling their truck, as suggested in statement 14.

Statement 3 aligns with my comment in acknowledging that idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel. I would recommend the OP to check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (statement 3) before taking any further action.

Statement 5 highlights the fact that older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes. This statement is relevant to statement 3, as it provides more context on why idling may be necessary in some cases.

Statement 4 reinforces the idea that idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel. I agree with this statement, but I would prioritize statement 3, as it encourages the OP to check local laws and ordinances first.

Statement 7 notes that stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK. This statement is relevant to statement 3, as it provides more information on the legal aspects of idling.

Statement 15 suggests checking if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck. This statement is relevant to statement 3, as it encourages the OP to consider the environmental impact of idling.

Statement 10 suggests checking if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street. While this statement is not directly related to the issue of idling, it is still relevant in addressing the overall situation with the neighbor.

Statement 6 suggests using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation. While this statement is not a solution to the idling issue, it can still be helpful for the OP in dealing with the noise.

Statement 2 suggests reporting the neighbor to the police for excessive noise. While this statement may be a viable option, I would recommend the OP to try the less confrontational approaches first, such as those suggested in statements 14 and 1.

Statement 12 suggests calling the police every day to report the noise until something is done. I strongly disagree with this statement, as it can escalate the situation and create unnecessary tension between the OP and their neighbor.

Statement 13 suggests taking the truck to the nearest police station and leaving it there. I also strongly disagree with this statement, as it is an extreme and confrontational approach that can worsen the situation.

Statement 8 suggests recording the engine noise and playing it back to the neighbor to make a point. While this statement may be effective in making the neighbor aware of the noise, I would still recommend the OP to try the less confrontational approaches first.

Statement 9 suggests putting a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement. I strongly disagree with this statement, as it is a dangerous and illegal action that can cause damage to the neighbor's truck.

Statement 11 suggests using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor. While this statement may be effective in making the neighbor aware of the noise, I would still recommend the OP to try the less confrontational approaches first."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the FIL in this situation deserves respect and communication, rather than outright refusal and lying. Therefore, I strongly disagree with statement 3, which suggests taking the truck to the nearest police station and leaving it there. I also disagree with statement 12, which suggests calling the police every day to report the noise, as this seems overly aggressive and confrontational. Instead, I believe that communication and understanding are key, so I agree with statement 14, which suggests talking to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation. I also agree with statement 10, which suggests checking if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street, as this could be a simple solution to the problem.

In terms of the other statements, I believe that it is important to consider cultural differences and the potential reasons for the neighbor's actions (statement 5), as well as local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (statement 3). I also agree that idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel (statement 4), and that stationary idling is an offense in some places (statement 7). However, I believe that taking drastic measures such as putting a potato in the tailpipe (statement 9) or using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise (statement 11) are not productive or respectful ways to handle the situation.

Instead, I suggest trying to understand the situation from the neighbor's perspective and finding a compromise that works for both parties. If communication and understanding fail, then it may be necessary to take more drastic measures such as reporting the neighbor to the police for excessive noise (statement 2). However, I believe that this should be a last resort, and that efforts should be made to resolve the issue peacefully and respectfully."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that the OP is not the asshole here, but there are still some actions that could have been taken to handle the situation more smoothly. I ranked statement 3 (Idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel) as the most liked because it directly addresses the issue of the neighbor idling their truck for an extended period of time. Statement 4 (Check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels) and 5 (Older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes) are also highly ranked because they provide a solution to the problem while also considering the neighbor's perspective.

Statement 1 (Talk to the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck) is ranked lower because, while it is a valid solution, it may not be effective if the neighbor is not willing to cooperate. Statement 15 (Check if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck) is ranked similarly because it is a more formal way of addressing the issue, but it may take longer to see results.

Statement 10 (Check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street) and 14 (Talk to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation) are ranked lower because they do not directly address the issue of idling. Statement 6 (Consider using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation) is ranked even lower because it is more of a personal solution for the OP rather than a solution to the problem at hand.

Statement 2 (Report the neighbor to the police for excessive noise) and 12 (Call the police every day to report the noise until something is done) are ranked near the bottom because they escalate the situation and may not be the most effective way to handle the issue. Statement 13 (Take the truck to the nearest police station and leave it there) and 9 (Put a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement) are ranked the lowest because they are extreme measures that are unlikely to be taken and may even be illegal. Statement 8 (Record the engine noise and play it back to the neighbor to make a point) and 11 (Use a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor) are ranked slightly higher than the previous two statements because they are less extreme, but still may not be the most effective way to handle the situation."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the OP is the asshole for how they handled the situation with their FIL's food. However, I do agree that the neighbor's idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel (statement 4). I also agree that the neighbor should check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (statement 3) and that older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes (statement 5).

I think the first step should be to talk to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation (statement 14), as it is a more peaceful and respectful approach. If that doesn't work, then the next step would be to check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (statement 3) and to check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street (statement 10).

If the neighbor is violating any laws or ordinances, then the next step would be to report them to the police for excessive noise (statement 2) or to take the truck to the nearest police station and leave it there (statement 13). However, these steps should be taken as a last resort, after all other options have been exhausted.

I do not agree with putting a potato in the tailpipe (statement 9) or recording the engine noise and playing it back to the neighbor (statement 8) as they are not peaceful or respectful approaches. I also do not agree with calling the police every day to report the noise (statement 12) as it is excessive and may not be effective.

I think using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation (statement 6) is a good option, but it should be used in conjunction with other steps to address the root cause of the problem. I also think that the OP should consider seeking professional help for their ED (statement 2) as it is not a reasonable habit and it is important to take care of one's health."

If talking to the neighbor does not work, then the next step would be to check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (1, 7, 15). If the neighbor is violating these laws, then reporting them to the police would be appropriate (2). However, it is important to note that idling for a short period of time may be necessary for older diesel trucks to warm up (5), so it is worth checking with the neighbor to see if this is the case before taking any further action. If the idling is excessive and unnecessary, then it is a waste of fuel (4) and the neighbor would be TA if they continue to do it.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I do not think the poster is an asshole, so I am more likely to agree with statements that suggest the neighbor is in the wrong. Statement 3, ""Check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels,"" aligns with this perspective, as it encourages the poster to look into potential legal violations. Statement 4, ""Idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel,"" and 5, ""Older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes,"" both highlight the unnecessary nature of the neighbor's actions. Statement 7, ""Stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK,"" further supports the idea that the neighbor may be breaking the law.

Statement 1, ""Talk to the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck,"" is reasonable, but I would only agree with it if the poster has already checked local laws and found that the neighbor is not violating any ordinances. Statement 15, ""Check if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck,"" is also reasonable, but I put it after statement 1 because it is more specific and should be considered after the broader issue of local laws and ordinances has been addressed.

Statement 10, ""Check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street,"" is less important than the other statements, as it does not directly address the issue of idling. Statements 6, ""Consider using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation,"" and 14, ""Talk to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation,"" are more about the poster's personal comfort and are less important than addressing the neighbor's actions.

While they may be valid options, I put them towards the end of the list because they should only be considered after other, less confrontational options have been explored.

I also agree that checking local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (3) and talking to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck (14) are good steps to take. I agree that idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel (4), and that older diesel trucks may not need to warm up for that long (5). Checking if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck (15) and if they are allowed to park their truck on the street (10) are also important. I agree that using a noise machine or earplugs (6) could help with sleep deprivation, but I think addressing the root cause (the idling truck) is more important. I do not agree with calling the police every day (12) or taking the truck to the nearest police station (13) as these actions could escalate the situation unnecessarily. I also do not agree with putting a potato in the tailpipe (9) as it is not a productive or safe way to address the issue."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I don't think the neighbor is doing anything illegal or harmful by idling their truck for a short period of time to warm up the engine. Therefore, I agree with the statements that suggest talking to the neighbor and asking them to stop idling their truck (1), checking local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (3), and checking if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck (15). I also agree that idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel (4), and that older diesel trucks may not need to warm up for 30 minutes (5).

I disagree with the more extreme statements, such as reporting the neighbor to the police for excessive noise (2), taking the truck to the nearest police station and leaving it there (13), and putting a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement (9). These actions seem excessive and could escalate the situation unnecessarily. I also disagree with the statements that suggest using noise machines or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation (6), as this does not address the root cause of the problem.

I have ranked the remaining statements based on their relevance and practicality. For example, I have ranked checking if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street (10) lower because it is not directly related to the issue of idling, and using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor (11) lower because it seems like it could be confrontational and potentially escalate the situation. I have also ranked calling the police every day to report the noise until something is done (12) lower because it could be seen as harassment and could also escalate the situation."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that talking to the neighbor is the best course of action. Therefore, statement 14 (Talk to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation) is the most liked. Statement 1 (Talk to the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck) is also a reasonable and non-confrontational approach, so it is second. Statement 10 (Check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street) is important to know before taking any further action, so it is third. Statement 15 (Check if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck) is also relevant and should be considered, so it is fourth. Statement 5 (Older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes) and 4 (Idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel) highlight the unnecessary and environmentally unfriendly nature of the neighbor's actions, so they are fifth and sixth respectively. Statement 7 (Stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK) and 11 (Use a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor) are more aggressive approaches, but could be considered if talking to the neighbor doesn't work, so they are seventh and eighth. Statement 16 (Have you tried talking to him at all about this?) is my own comment, which I included in the slate for the sake of completeness, it is ninth. Statement 2 (Report the neighbor to the police for excessive noise) is a more drastic measure, and should only be considered if all other options have been exhausted, so it is tenth. Statement 3 (Check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels) is important to know, but should be done after talking to the neighbor, so it is eleventh. Statement 6 (Consider using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation) is a personal solution, but doesn't address the root cause of the problem, so it is twelfth. Statement 8 (Record the engine noise and play it back to the neighbor to make a point) is a more aggressive approach, but could be considered if talking to the neighbor doesn't work, so it is thirteenth. Statement 9 (Put a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement) is a destructive and illegal action, so it is fourteenth. Statement 12 (Call the police every day to report the noise until something is done) and 13 (Take the truck to the nearest police station and leave it there) are the most aggressive and destructive actions, and should only be considered as a last resort, so they are fifteenth and sixteenth."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the original poster (OP) is the asshole here. However, I do believe that there are better ways to handle the situation than yelling at the neighbor. I agree with statement 3, which suggests checking local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels. This is a responsible and proactive approach to the situation. Statement 5, which states that older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes, is also reasonable. It's important to consider the neighbor's perspective and the potential reasons for their actions. Statement 4, which states that idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel, is a valid point, but it's not the most pressing concern in this situation.

I also agree with statement 1, which suggests talking to the neighbor and asking them to stop idling their truck. This is a reasonable and respectful way to address the issue. Statement 15, which suggests checking if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck, is a good idea as well. It's important to consider the potential environmental impact of the neighbor's actions. Statement 14, which suggests talking to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation, is a wise approach. It's important to approach the situation in a calm and respectful manner.

Statement 7, which states that stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK, is relevant, but it's not clear if it applies to the OP's situation. Statement 10, which suggests checking if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street, is also relevant, but it doesn't directly address the issue of idling.

Statement 6, which suggests using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation, is a valid solution, but it doesn't address the root cause of the problem. Statement 2, which suggests reporting the neighbor to the police for excessive noise, is an option, but it should be a last resort. Statement 12, which suggests calling the police every day to report the noise until something is done, is an extreme measure and not a constructive way to handle the situation. Statement 13, which suggests taking the truck to the nearest police station and leaving it there, is also an extreme measure and not a reasonable solution.

Statement 8, which suggests recording the engine noise and playing it back to the neighbor to make a point, is not a productive way to communicate with the neighbor. Statement 9, which suggests putting a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement, is not a peaceful or respectful way to handle the situation. Statement 11, which suggests using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor, is not a constructive solution.

In summary, I believe that the best course of action is to first check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels, and then to approach the neighbor in a calm and respectful manner to discuss the issue. It's important to consider the neighbor's perspective and the potential reasons for their actions, and to find a solution that works for both parties."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I understand the situation and feel bad for the neighbors. I am willing to minimize the noise as much as possible. I believe the best course of action is to communicate with the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck (14). If that doesn't work, I would check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (1, 7, 15). I would also check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street (10) and if they are violating any environmental ordinances (15). I agree that idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel (4, 5), and I would suggest the neighbor to consider using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation (6). I would not report the neighbor to the police for excessive noise (2) or take the truck to the nearest police station and leave it there (13) as I believe communication and understanding should be the first steps. I would also not use extreme measures such as putting a potato in the tailpipe (9) or calling the police every day to report the noise (12)."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I am not advocating for any extreme measures such as putting a potato in the tailpipe or taking the truck to the police station. I am also not suggesting that the neighbor is breaking any laws, so reporting them to the police or checking local ordinances is not a priority. I am suggesting that the OP talk to their neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck, especially at 4:30 am. I also think it's important to check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street and if they are violating any environmental ordinances. If talking to the neighbor doesn't work, the OP could try using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation. Recording the engine noise and playing it back to the neighbor could also be an option. I do think that idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel, especially for older diesel trucks that may not need to warm up for that long. However, I don't think the OP should take the truck to the police station or call the police every day to report the noise.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think it's best to first talk to the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck (1). Talking to them when they are not idling their truck can help avoid confrontation (14). Additionally, checking if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street (10) and if they are violating any environmental ordinances by idling their truck (15) can help address the issue. I also agree that idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel (5), and that the neighbor should check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (3). 

While I understand the frustration of the situation, I do not think it's productive to call the police every day to report the noise (12) or to take the truck to the nearest police station and leave it there (13). These actions may escalate the situation and may not be effective in resolving the issue. Similarly, I do not think it's a good idea to put a potato in the tailpipe (9) or to use a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise (11) as these actions may also escalate the situation.

Instead, I suggest using a noise machine or earplugs (6) to help with sleep deprivation. Additionally, recording the engine noise and playing it back to the neighbor (8) can help make a point. However, I think it's important to approach the situation calmly and rationally, and to try to find a solution that works for both parties. Therefore, I rank these options lower on the list.

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that the best course of action is to first educate oneself on local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (3). This is because understanding the rules and regulations will provide a solid foundation for addressing the issue. Next, I would suggest addressing the neighbor and asking them to stop idling their truck (1), but only when they are not currently idling the truck to avoid confrontation (14). If the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street (10) and is not violating any environmental ordinances (15), then it's important to consider that older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes (5).

REASONING: Based on my comment, I understand the frustration and anger that the original poster (OP) must have felt due to the sleep deprivation caused by the neighbor's idling truck. I believe the most constructive and respectful approach would be to first talk to the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck (statement 1). I would recommend doing this when the neighbor is not idling their truck to avoid confrontation (statement 14). It is also important to check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street (statement 10) and if they are violating any environmental ordinances by idling their truck (statement 15).

If talking to the neighbor does not work, I would then suggest checking local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (statement 3) and recording the engine noise to play it back to the neighbor (statement 8) to make a point. I would also recommend checking if older diesel trucks really need to warm up for 30 minutes (statement 5) and considering using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation (statement 6).

If the situation still does not improve, I would consider reporting the neighbor to the police for excessive noise (statement 2) or taking the truck to the nearest police station and leaving it there (statement 13) as a last resort.

I would also suggest checking local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels, as well as checking if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street. It's important to approach the situation in a polite and non-confrontational manner, such as talking to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck.

However, I would not suggest taking drastic measures such as recording the engine noise, putting a potato in the tailpipe, or taking the truck to the police station. These actions may escalate the situation and damage the relationship with the neighbor.

I would also suggest using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation, as this is a more peaceful and individual solution. Calling the police every day or leaving the truck at the police station may be seen as overly aggressive and could lead to legal consequences.

Statement 14 is also highly ranked because it suggests talking to the neighbor at a time when they are not idling their truck, which could be more effective. Statement 10 is ranked next because it is important to check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street. Statement 5 is ranked next because idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel. Statement 7 is ranked next because stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK. Statement 15 is ranked next because it is important to check if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck. Statement 4 is ranked next because it is important to note that idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel. Statement 3 is ranked next because it is important to check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels. Statement 11 is ranked next because it is a more passive-aggressive approach to the situation. Statement 12 is ranked next because it is an extreme measure and could escalate the situation. Statement 6 is ranked next because it is a personal solution to the problem. Statement 2 is ranked next because it is an extreme measure and could escalate the situation. Statement 8 is ranked next because it is a more passive-aggressive approach to the situation. Statement 9 is ranked next because it is an extreme measure and could escalate the situation. Statement 13 is ranked last because it is an extreme measure and could escalate the situation. Statement 16 and 17 are not included in the original slate, but I added them as additional suggestions based on the description and my comment. Statement 16 suggests using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor, and statement 17 suggests taking the truck to the nearest police station and leaving it there."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think it's important to gather information and approach the situation reasonably. Therefore, I would rank checking local laws and ordinances (3) as the most liked statement, followed by talking to the neighbor (1) and checking if the neighbor's truck is an older diesel model (5), as these are all reasonable steps to take before escalating the situation. I would then rank statements that address the unnecessary idling and potential environmental impact (4, 7, 15) as the next most liked, as they are still reasonable but may not be as effective in addressing the noise issue.

The next set of statements (14, 10, 6) are less liked because they involve avoiding confrontation or finding personal solutions to the noise issue, rather than addressing the root cause. I would rank statements that involve escalating the situation or taking drastic actions (2, 8, 13, 12, 11, 9) as the least liked, as they are unlikely to be effective or productive in resolving the issue with the neighbor."

REASONING: Based on the comment, it seems that the original poster (OP) is in the right for being frustrated with their neighbor, but it may not be the best course of action to escalate the situation to the police or take drastic measures like leaving the truck at the police station. It's important to try to communicate with the neighbor first and ask them to stop idling their truck, especially since it is unnecessary and a waste of fuel. If the neighbor is violating any local laws or environmental ordinances, then it would be appropriate to report them. However, it's best to gather evidence and information first by checking local laws and ordinances and recording the engine noise. If the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street and is not violating any laws, then it may be worth considering using noise-cancelling methods like earplugs or a noise machine to help with sleep deprivation. It's also important to approach the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation. Overall, the most preferred options involve communication and trying to resolve the issue peacefully, while the least preferred options involve escalating the situation or taking drastic measures without proper evidence or justification."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe that talking to the neighbor is a reasonable first step. Statement 14, ""Talk to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation,"" is the most liked statement because it allows for communication without causing a scene. Statement 1, ""Talk to the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck,"" is the second most liked statement because it directly addresses the issue. Statement 3, ""Check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels,"" is the third most liked statement because it is important to know the legal aspects of the situation. Statement 5, ""Older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes,"" and statement 4, ""Idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel,"" are both reasonable statements that highlight the unnecessary nature of the idling. Statement 7, ""Stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK,"" is a good point to consider, and statement 15, ""Check if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck,"" is also important to consider. Statement 10, ""Check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street,"" is a reasonable statement that could potentially solve the issue. Statement 6, ""Consider using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation,"" is a statement that I disagree with because it does not address the root cause of the problem. Statement 11, ""Use a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor,"" and statement 12, ""Call the police every day to report the noise until something is done,"" are both statements that I strongly disagree with because they escalate the situation unnecessarily. Statement 2, ""Report the neighbor to the police for excessive noise,"" is the least liked statement because it should be a last resort. Statement 8, ""Record the engine noise and play it back to the neighbor to make a point,"" and statement 9, ""Put a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement,"" are both statements that I strongly disagree with because they are petty and could potentially escalate the situation. Statement 13, ""Take the truck to the nearest police station and leave it there,"" is the least liked statement because it is an extreme measure that could potentially cause legal issues."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I don't think the original poster (OP) is an asshole for yelling at their neighbor. The neighbor's actions are causing disturbance early in the morning, and it's reasonable for OP to be upset. I agree with the statements that suggest talking to the neighbor, either during non-idling times (14) or directly asking them to stop idling (1). I also agree that idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel (4), and that older diesel trucks may not need to warm up for that long (5). Checking local laws and ordinances (3) and confirming if the neighbor is violating environmental regulations (15) are important steps to take.

I don't fully agree with the statements that suggest using noise machines or earplugs (6) or attempting to record and play back the noise (8, 11), as these actions might not address the root cause of the issue. I strongly disagree with escalating the situation by calling the police daily (12), taking the truck to the police station (13), or putting a potato in the tailpipe (9). These actions are likely to worsen the relationship between neighbors and may not be legal.

In summary, I support communication with the neighbor, understanding the local laws, and addressing the unnecessary idling. I do not support escalating the situation or taking drastic measures."

The neighbor is being inconsiderate by idling their truck for a long time, causing noise and carbon emissions.

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the most appropriate action is to call the police every day until something is done (12). This will put pressure on the authorities to take action against the neighbor for excessive noise (2). I also believe that stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK (7), and the neighbor should be reported to the police for this (2). Talking to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck (14) is a good idea, but it may not be effective, so it's important to have other options. I also think that older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes (5), and idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel (4).

REASONING: Based on my comment, I believe in addressing the issue directly with the neighbor first, which is why statement 1 (Talk to the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck) is the most liked. Statement 14 (Talk to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation) is also high up because it suggests a similar approach but at a more convenient time. Statement 10 (Check if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street) is next because it's important to ensure that the neighbor is not breaking any parking regulations. 

Statements 6 (Consider using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation) and 5 (Older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes) are next because they offer alternative solutions to the problem. Statement 4 (Idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel) is also high up because it highlights the environmental impact of idling. Statement 7 (Stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK) is next because it's important to be aware of local laws and ordinances. 

Statement 15 (Check if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck) is next because it's important to consider the environmental impact of idling. Statement 3 (Report the neighbor to the police for excessive noise) is low down because it's a more drastic measure and should only be considered if all other approaches have failed. Statement 11 (Use a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor) and 12 (Call the police every day to report the noise until something is done) are also low down because they are confrontational and may escalate the situation. 

Statement 2 (Record the engine noise and play it back to the neighbor to make a point) is next because it's a more passive-aggressive approach. Statement 8 (Put a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement) and 9 (Take the truck to the nearest police station and leave it there) are the least liked because they are extreme measures that could lead to legal consequences. Statement 13 (Call the police every day to report the noise until something is done) is also low down because it's a confrontational approach that may escalate the situation."

REASONING = Based on my comment, I believe that the neighbor is being inconsiderate and causing a disturbance, so the most liked statement would be to take action against the noise directly. Statement 9, putting a potato in the tailpipe, is a humorous way to make a statement and is ranked first. Statement 2, reporting the neighbor to the police, is ranked second as it is a more serious action to take. Statement 14, talking to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck, is ranked third as it is a more peaceful approach. Statement 1, talking to the neighbor and asking them to stop idling, is ranked fourth as it is a reasonable request. Statement 5, older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes, is ranked fifth as it acknowledges the possibility of a valid reason for idling. Statement 4, idling for 30 minutes is unnecessary and a waste of fuel, is ranked sixth as it highlights the negative impact of idling. Statement 6, considering using a noise machine or earplugs, is ranked seventh as it suggests a way for the OP to cope with the noise. Statement 7, stationary idling is an offense in some places, such as the UK, is ranked eighth as it highlights the illegality of idling in certain areas. Statement 15, checking if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances, is ranked ninth as it considers the environmental impact of idling. Statement 10, checking if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street, is ranked tenth as it addresses the legality of the truck's presence. Statement 3, checking local laws and ordinances, is ranked eleventh as it is a general suggestion. Statement 11, using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise, is ranked twelfth as it is an aggressive approach. Statement 12, calling the police every day, is ranked thirteenth as it is a time-consuming and potentially escalating action. Statement 13, taking the truck to the nearest police station, is ranked fourteenth as it is an extreme and impractical solution. Statement 8, recording the engine noise and playing it back, is ranked fifteenth as it is a passive-aggressive approach."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think it's important to first check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (3). If idling for an extended period is against the law, then reporting the neighbor to the police for excessive noise (7) would be the next logical step. I included talking to the neighbor when they are not idling their truck to avoid confrontation (14) and asking them to stop idling their truck (1) after checking local laws because it's possible that idling may not be against the law, but still unnecessary and a waste of fuel (4). I also included checking if the neighbor is violating environmental ordinances by idling their truck (15) because excessive idling can have negative environmental impacts. I included older diesel trucks may need to warm up, but not for 30 minutes (5) because it's possible that the neighbor may have a valid reason for idling, but still not for an extended period of time. I included checking if the neighbor is allowed to park their truck on the street (10) because it's possible that the neighbor may be allowed to park their truck on the street, but not allowed to idle it. I included using a noise machine or earplugs to help with sleep deprivation (6) because it's possible that the noise may be unavoidable and the OP may need to find alternative ways to sleep. I included recording the engine noise and playing it back to the neighbor to make a point (8) and using a conduction speaker to play back the truck noise to the neighbor (11) because it may help to make the neighbor aware of the noise they are making. I included calling the police every day to report the noise until something is done (12) and taking the truck to the nearest police station and leaving it there (13) as last resorts if the neighbor refuses to stop idling their truck. I included putting a potato in the tailpipe to make a statement (9) as the least preferred option because it's not a productive way to resolve the issue and could potentially damage the neighbor's truck."

REASONING: Based on my comment, I think the neighbor is being inconsiderate but not malicious. Therefore, the first step should be to communicate with the neighbor and ask them to stop idling their truck (14). If that doesn't work, then it's reasonable to ask them to turn off their truck when it's not in use (1). It's also important to check local laws and ordinances regarding idling and noise levels (3) and to educate the neighbor about the unnecessary waste of fuel (4) and potential environmental harm (5, 15). If the neighbor continues to idle their truck, then it's appropriate to report them to the authorities (7, 12, 13). However, I think it's better to try other methods first, such as using a noise machine or earplugs (6) or recording the engine noise to make a point (8). Some people may not realize the impact of their actions, so it's important to give them a chance to change before resorting to more drastic measures (9, 11). Finally, I think it's less productive to engage in escalating confrontations (2, 12, 13) or to take matters into one's own hands (9, 11)."
